<span id="toHide2" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> There are more bugs in real-world programs than human programmers can realistically address. This paper evaluates two research questions: ``What fraction of bugs can be repaired automatically?'' and ``How much does it cost to repair a bug automatically?'' In previous work, we presented GenProg, which uses genetic programming to repair defects in off-the-shelf C programs. To answer these questions, we: (1) propose novel algorithmic improvements to GenProg that allow it to scale to large programs and find repairs 68% more often, (2) exploit GenProg's inherent parallelism using cloud computing resources to provide grounded, human-competitive cost measurements, and (3) generate a large, indicative benchmark set to use for systematic evaluations. We evaluate GenProg on 105 defects from 8 open-source programs totaling 5.1 million lines of code and involving 10,193 test cases. GenProg automatically repairs 55 of those 105 defects. To our knowledge, this evaluation is the largest available of its kind, and is often two orders of magnitude larger than previous work in terms of code or test suite size or defect count. Public cloud computing prices allow our 105 runs to be reproduced for $403; a successful repair completes in 96 minutes and costs $7.32, on average. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll2" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll2',2)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide3" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> For a large and evolving software system, the project team could receive a large number of bug reports. Locating the source code files that need to be changed in order to fix the bugs is a challenging task. Once a bug report is received, it is desirable to automatically point out to the files that developers should change in order to fix the bug. In this paper, we propose BugLocator, an information retrieval based method for locating the relevant files for fixing a bug. BugLocator ranks all files based on the textual similarity between the initial bug report and the source code using a revised Vector Space Model (rVSM), taking into consideration information about similar bugs that have been fixed before. We perform large-scale experiments on four open source projects to localize more than 3,000 bugs. The results show that BugLocator can effectively locate the files where the bugs should be fixed. For example, relevant buggy files for 62.60% Eclipse 3.1 bugs are ranked in the top ten among 12,863 files. Our experiments also show that BugLocator outperforms existing state-of-the-art bug localization methods. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll3" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll3',3)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide4" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Developers build all the software artifacts in development. Existing work has studied the social behavior in software repositories. In one of the most important software repositories, a bug repository, developers create and update bug reports to support software development and maintenance. However, no prior work has considered the priorities of developers in bug repositories. In this paper, we address the problem of the developer prioritization, which aims to rank the contributions of developers. We mainly explore two aspects, namely modeling the developer prioritization in a bug repository and assisting predictive tasks with our model. First, we model how to assign the priorities of developers based on a social network technique. Three problems are investigated, including the developer rankings in products, the evolution over time, and the tolerance of noisy comments. Second, we consider leveraging the developer prioritization to improve three predicted tasks in bug repositories, i.e., bug triage, severity identification, and reopened bug prediction. We empirically investigate the performance of our model and its applications in bug repositories of Eclipse and Mozilla. The results indicate that the developer prioritization can provide the knowledge of developer priorities to assist software tasks, especially the task of bug triage. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll4" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll4',4)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide5" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> This paper describes a new technique, which automatically selects the most appropriate developers for fixing the fault represented by a failing test case, and provides a diagnosis of where to look for the fault. This technique works by incorporating three key components: (1) fault localization to inform locations whose execution correlate with failure, (2) history mining to inform which developers edited each line of code and when, and (3) expertise assignment to map locations to developers. To our knowledge, the technique is the first to assign developers to execution failures, without the need for textual bug reports. We implement this technique in our tool, WhoseFault, and describe an experiment where we utilize a large, open-source project to determine the frequency in which our tool suggests an assignment to the actual developer who fixed the fault. Our results show that 81% of the time, WhoseFault produced the same developer that actually fixed the fault within the top three suggestions. We also show that our technique improved by a difference between 4% and 40% the results of a baseline technique. Finally, we explore the influence of each of the three components of our technique over its results, and compare our expertise algorithm against an existing expertise assessment technique and find that our algorithm provides greater accuracy, by up to 37%. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll5" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll5',5)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide7" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Large frameworks and libraries require extensive developer learning resources, such as documentation and mailing lists, to be useful. Maintaining these learning resources is challenging partly because they are not explicitly linked to the frameworks' API, and changes in the API are not reflected in the learning resources. Automatically recovering traceability links between an API and learning resources is notoriously difficult due to the inherent ambiguity of unstructured natural language. Code elements mentioned in documents are rarely fully qualified, so readers need to understand the context in which a code element is mentioned. We propose a technique that identifies code-like terms in documents and links these terms to specific code elements in an API, such as methods. In an evaluation study with four open source systems, we found that our technique had an average recall and precision of 96%. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll7" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll7',7)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide8" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> To prevent ill-formed configurations, highly configurable software often allows defining constraints over the available options. As these constraints can be complex, fixing a configuration that violates one or more constraints can be challenging. Although several fix-generation approaches exist, their applicability is limited because (1) they typically generate only one fix, failing to cover the solution that the user wants; and (2) they do not fully support non-Boolean constraints, which contain arithmetic, inequality, and string operators. </p> <p> This paper proposes a novel concept, range fix, for software configuration. A range fix specifies the options to change and the ranges of values for these options. We also design an algorithm that automatically generates range fixes for a violated constraint. We have evaluated our approach with three different strategies for handling constraint interactions, on data from five open source projects. Our evaluation shows that, even with the most complex strategy, our approach generates complete fix lists that are mostly short and concise, in a fraction of a second. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll8" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll8',8)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide9" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Code completion helps improve programming productivity. However, current support for code completion is limited to context-free code templates or a single method call of the variable on focus. Using libraries for development, developers often repeat API usages for certain tasks. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce GraPacc, a graph-based pattern-oriented, context-sensitive code completion approach that is based on a database of API usage patterns. GraPacc manages and represents the API usage patterns of multiple variables, methods, and control structures via graph-based models. It extracts the context-sensitive features from the code, e.g. the API elements on focus or under modification, and their relations to other elements. The features are used to search and rank the patterns that are most fitted with the current code. When a pattern is selected, the current code will be completed via our novel graph-based code completion algorithm. Empirical evaluation on several real-world systems and human subjects shows that GraPacc has a high level of accuracy and a better level of usefulness than existing tools. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll9" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll9',9)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide10" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p>We present a novel technique, automatic input rectification, and a prototype implementation, SOAP. SOAP learns a set of constraints characterizing typical inputs that an application is highly likely to process correctly. When given an atypical input that does not satisfy these constraints, SOAP automatically rectifies the input (i.e., changes the input so that is satisfies the learned constraints). The goal is to automatically convert potentially dangerous inputs into typical inputs that the program is highly likely to process correctly. Our experimental results show that, for a set of benchmark applications (namely, Google Picasa, ImageMagick, VLC, Swfdec, and Dillo), this approach effectively converts malicious inputs (which successfully exploit vulnerabilities in the application) into benign inputs that the application processes correctly. Moreover, a manual code analysis shows that, if an input does satisfy the learned constraints, it is incapable of exploiting these vulnerabilities. We also present the results of a user study designed to evaluate the subjective perceptual quality of outputs from benign but atypical inputs that have been automatically rectified by SOAP to conform to the learned constraints. Specifically, we obtained benign inputs that violate learned constraints, used our input rectifier to obtain rectified inputs, then paid Amazon Mechanical Turk users to provide their subjective qualitative perception of the difference between the outputs from the original and rectified inputs. The results indicate that rectification can often preserve much, and in many cases all, of the desirable data in the original input. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll10" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll10',10)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide12" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline">We describe how we studied, in-situ, the operational processes of three large high process maturity distributed software development companies and discovered three common problems they faced with respect to early stage project cost estimation. We found that project managers faced significant challenges to accurately estimate project costs because the standard metrics-based estimation tools they used (a) did not effectively incorporate diverse distributed project configurations and characteristics, (b) required comprehensive data that was not fully available for all starting projects, and (c) required significant domain experience to derive accurate estimates. To address these challenges, we collaborated with practitioners at the three firms and developed a new learningoriented and semi-automated early-stage cost estimation solution that was specifically designed for globally distributed software projects. The key idea of our solution was to augment the existing metrics-driven estimation methods with a case repository that stratified past incidents related to project effort estimation issues from the historical project databases at the firms into several generalizable categories. This repository allowed project managers to quickly and effectively &#8220;benchmark&#8221; their new projects to all past projects across the firms, and thereby learn from them. We deployed our solution at each of our three research sites for real-world field-testing over a period of six months. Project managers of 219 new large globally distributed projects used both our method to estimate the cost of their projects as well as the established metricsbased estimation approaches they were used to. Our approach achieved significantly reduced estimation errors (of up to 60%). This resulted in more than 20% net cost savings, on average, per project &#8211; a massive total cost savings across all projects at the three firms!</div></span> <a id="expcoll12" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll12',12)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide13" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Software logging is a conventional programming practice. As its efficacy is often important for users and developers to understand what have happened in production run, yet software logging is often done in an arbitrarily manner. So far, there have been little study for understanding logging practices in real world software. This paper makes the first attempt (to the best of our knowledge) to provide quantitative characteristic study of the current log messages within four pieces of large open-source software. First, we quantitatively show that software logging is pervasive. By examining developers&#8217; own modifications to logging code in revision history, we find that they often do not make the log messages right in their first attempts, and thus need to spend significant amount of efforts to modify the log messages as after-thoughts. Our study further provides several interesting findings on where developers spend most of their efforts in modifying the log messages, which can give insights for programmers, tool developers, and language and compiler designers to improve the current logging practice. To demonstrate the benefit of our study, we built a simple checker based on one of our findings and effectively detected 138 new problematic logging code from studied software (24 of them are already confirmed and fixed by developers). </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll13" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll13',13)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide14" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> This paper presents the results of a systematic review on the impacts of Software Process Improvement (SPI) on developers. This review selected 26 studies from the highest quality journals, conferences, and workshop in the field. The results were compiled and organized following the grounded theory approach. Results from the grounded theory were further categorized using the Ishikawa (or fishbone) diagram. The Ishikawa Diagram models all the factors potentially impacting software developers, and shows both the positive and negative impacts. Positive impacts include a reduction in the number of crises, and an increase in team communications and morale, as well as better requirements and documentation. Negative impacts include increased overhead on developers through the need to collect data and compile documentation, an undue focus on technical approaches, and the fact that SPI is oriented toward management and process quality, and not towards developers and product quality. This systematic review should support future practice through the identification of important obstacles and opportunities for achieving SPI success. Future research should also benefit from the problems and advantages of SPI identified by developers. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll14" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll14',14)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide15" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Recent multi-paradigm programming languages combine functional and imperative programming styles to make software development easier. Given today's proliferation of multicore processors, parallel programmers are supposed to benefit from this combination, as many difficult problems can be expressed more easily in a functional style while others match an imperative style. Due to a lack of empirical evidence from controlled studies, however, important software engineering questions are largely unanswered. Our paper is the first to provide thorough empirical results by using Scala and Java as a vehicle in a controlled comparative study on multicore software development. Scala combines functional and imperative programming while Java focuses on imperative shared-memory programming. We study thirteen programmers who worked on three projects, including an industrial application, in both Scala and Java. In addition to the resulting 39 Scala programs and 39 Java programs, we obtain data from an industry software engineer who worked on the same project in Scala. We analyze key issues such as effort, code, language usage, performance, and programmer satisfaction. Contrary to popular belief, the functional style does not lead to bad performance. Average Scala run-times are comparable to Java, lowest run-times are sometimes better, but Java scales better on parallel hardware. We confirm with statistical significance Scala's claim that Scala code is more compact than Java code, but clearly refute other claims of Scala on lower programming effort and lower debugging effort. Our study also provides explanations for these observations and shows directions on how to improve multi-paradigm languages in the future. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll15" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll15',15)">expand</a>

Bloat significantly affects scalability and performance, and exposing it requires good diagnostic tools. We present a novel analysis that profiles the run-time execution to help programmers uncover potential performance problems. The key idea of the proposed approach is to track object references, starting from object creation statements, through assignment statements, and eventually statements that perform useful operations. This propagation is abstracted by a representation we refer to as a reference propagation graph. This graph provides path information specific to reference producers and their run-time contexts. Several client analyses demonstrate the use of reference propagation profiling to uncover run-time inefficiencies. We also present a study of the properties of reference propagation graphs produced by profiling 36 Java programs. Several cases studies discuss the inefficiencies identified in some of the analyzed programs, as well as the significant improvements obtained after code optimizations. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll17" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll17',17)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide18" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Given limited resource and time before software release, development-site testing and debugging become more and more insufficient to ensure satisfactory software performance. As a counterpart for debugging in the large pioneered by the Microsoft Windows Error Reporting (WER) system focusing on crashing/hanging bugs, performance debugging in the large has emerged thanks to available infrastructure support to collect execution traces with performance issues from a huge number of users at the deployment sites. However, performance debugging against these numerous and complex traces remains a significant challenge for performance analysts. In this paper, to enable performance debugging in the large in practice, we propose a novel approach, called StackMine, that mines callstack traces to help performance analysts effectively discover highly impactful performance bugs (e.g., bugs impacting many users with long response delay). As a successful technology-transfer effort, since December 2010, StackMine has been applied in performance-debugging activities at a Microsoft team for performance analysis, especially for a large number of execution traces. Based on real-adoption experiences of StackMine in practice, we conducted an evaluation of StackMine on performance debugging in the large for Microsoft Windows 7. We also conducted another evaluation on a third-party application. The results highlight substantial benefits offered by StackMine in performance debugging in the large for large-scale software systems. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll18" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll18',18)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide20" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Customizable programs and program families provide user-selectable features to allow users to tailor a program to an application scenario. Knowing in advance which feature selection yields the best performance is difficult because a direct measurement of all possible feature combinations is infeasible. Our work aims at predicting program performance based on selected features. However, when features interact, accurate predictions are challenging. An interaction occurs when a particular feature combination has an unexpected influence on performance. We present a method that automatically detects performance-relevant feature interactions to improve prediction accuracy. To this end, we propose three heuristics to reduce the number of measurements required to detect interactions. Our evaluation consists of six real-world case studies from varying domains (e.g., databases, encoding libraries, and web servers) using different configuration techniques (e.g., configuration files and preprocessor flags). Results show an average prediction accuracy of 95%. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll20" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll20',20)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide22" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Several promising techniques have been proposed to automate different tasks in software testing, such as test data generation for object-oriented software. However, reported studies in the literature only show the feasibility of the proposed techniques, because the choice of the employed artifacts in the case studies (e.g., software applications) is usually done in a non-systematic way. The chosen case study might be biased, and so it might not be a valid representative of the addressed type of software (e.g., internet applications and embedded systems). The common trend seems to be to accept this fact and get over it by simply discussing it in a threats to validity section. In this paper, we evaluate search-based software testing (in particular the EvoSuite tool) when applied to test data generation for open source projects. To achieve sound empirical results, we randomly selected 100 Java projects from SourceForge, which is the most popular open source repository (more than 300,000 projects with more than two million registered users). The resulting case study not only is very large (8,784 public classes for a total of 291,639 bytecode level branches), but more importantly it is statistically sound and representative for open source projects. Results show that while high coverage on commonly used types of classes is achievable, in practice environmental dependencies prohibit such high coverage, which clearly points out essential future research directions. To support this future research, our SF100 case study can serve as a much needed corpus of classes for test generation. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll22" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll22',22)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide23" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Ideally, we can learn lessons from software projects across multiple organizations. However, a major impediment to such knowledge sharing are the privacy concerns of software development organizations. This paper aims to provide defect data-set owners with an effective means of privatizing their data prior to release. We explore MORPH which understands how to maintain class boundaries in a data-set. MORPH is a data mutator that moves the data a random distance, taking care not to cross class boundaries. The value of training on this MORPHed data is tested via a 10-way within learning study and a cross learning study using Random Forests, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression for ten object-oriented defect data-sets from the PROMISE data repository. Measured in terms of exposure of sensitive attributes, the MORPHed data was four times more private than the unMORPHed data. Also, in terms of the f-measures, there was little difference between the MORPHed and unMORPHed data (original data and data privatized by data-swapping) for both the cross and within study. We conclude that at least for the kinds of OO defect data studied in this project, data can be privatized without concerns for inference efficacy. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll23" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll23',23)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide24" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> There have been many bug prediction models built with historical metrics, which are mined from version histories of software modules. Many studies have reported the effectiveness of these historical metrics. For prediction levels, most studies have targeted package and file levels. Prediction on a fine-grained level, which represents the method level, is required because there may be interesting results compared to coarse-grained (package and file levels) prediction. These results include good performance when considering quality assurance efforts, and new findings about the correlations between bugs and histories. However, fine-grained prediction has been a challenge because obtaining method histories from existing version control systems is a difficult problem. To tackle this problem, we have developed a fine-grained version control system for Java, Historage. With this system, we target Java software and conduct fine-grained prediction with well-known historical metrics. The results indicate that fine-grained (method-level) prediction outperforms coarse-grained (package and file levels) prediction when taking the efforts necessary to find bugs into account. Using a correlation analysis, we show that past bug information does not contribute to method-level bug prediction. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll24" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll24',24)">expand</a>

One cause of this underuse is that a developer sometimes fails to recognize that she is going to refactor before she begins manually refactoring. To address this issue, we conducted a formative study of developers&#8217; manual refactoring process, suggesting that developers&#8217; reliance on &#8220;chasing error messages&#8221; when manually refactoring is an error-prone manual refactoring strategy. Additionally, our study distilled a set of manual refactoring workflow patterns. Using these patterns, we designed a novel refactoring tool called BeneFactor. BeneFactor detects a developer&#8217;s manual refactoring, reminds her that automatic refactoring is available, and can complete her refactoring automatically. By alleviating the burden of recognizing manual refactoring, BeneFactor is designed to help solve the refactoring tool underuse problem. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll26" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll26',26)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide27" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) have come to perform a wide variety of tasks on behalf of the programmer, refactoring being a classic example. These operations have undeniable benefits, yet their large (and growing) number poses a cognitive scalability problem. Our main contribution is WitchDoctor -- a system that can detect, on the fly, when a programmer is hand-coding a refactoring. The system can then complete the refactoring in the background and propose it to the user long before the user can complete it. This implies a number of technical challenges. The algorithm must be 1) highly efficient, 2) handle unparseable programs, 3) tolerate the variety of ways programmers may perform a given refactoring, 4) use the IDE's proven and familiar refactoring engine to perform the refactoring, even though the the refactoring has already begun, and 5) support the wide range of refactorings present in modern IDEs. Our techniques for overcoming these challenges are the technical contributions of this paper. We evaluate WitchDoctor's design and implementation by simulating over 5,000 refactoring operations across three open-source projects. The simulated user is faster and more efficient than an average human user, yet WitchDoctor can detect more than 90% of refactoring operations as they are being performed -- and can complete over a third of refactorings before the simulated user does. All the while, WitchDoctor remains robust in the face of non-parseable programs and unpredictable refactoring scenarios. We also show that WitchDoctor is efficient enough to perform computation on a keystroke-by-keystroke basis, adding an average overhead of only 15 milliseconds per keystroke. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll27" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll27',27)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide28" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Though refactoring tools have been available for more than a decade, research has shown that programmers underutilize such tools. However, little is known about why programmers do not take advantage of these tools. We have conducted a field study on programmers in their natural settings working on their code. As a result, we collected a set of interaction data from about 1268 hours of programming using our minimally intrusive data collectors. Our quantitative data show that programmers prefer lightweight methods of invoking refactorings, usually perform small changes using the refactoring tool, proceed with an automated refactoring even when it may change the behavior of the program, and rarely preview the automated refactorings. We also interviewed nine of our participants to provide deeper insight about the patterns that we observed in the behavioral data. We found that programmers use predictable automated refactorings even if they have rare bugs or change the behavior of the program. This paper reports some of the factors that affect the use of automated refactorings such as invocation method, awareness, naming, trust, and predictability and the major mismatches between programmers' expectations and automated refactorings. The results of this work contribute to producing more effective tools for refactoring complex software. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll28" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll28',28)">expand</a>

The objective of this paper is to find out how developers address this test challenge. To that end, we conduct a qualitative (grounded theory) study, in which we interview 25 senior practitioners about how they test plug-ins and applications built on top of the Eclipse plug-in framework. The outcome is an overview of the testing practices currently used, a set of identified barriers limiting the adoption of test practices, and an explanation of how limited testing is compensated by self-hosting of projects and by involving the community. These results are supported by a structured survey of more than 150 professionals. The study reveals that unit testing plays a key role, whereas plug-in specific integration problems are identified and resolved by the community. Based on our findings, we propose a series of recommendations and areas for future research. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll30" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll30',30)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide31" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Research in program comprehension has considerably evolved over the past two decades. However, only little is known about how developers practice program comprehension under time and project pressure, and which methods and tools proposed by researchers are used in industry. This paper reports on an observational study of 28 professional developers from seven companies, investigating how developers comprehend software. In particular we focus on the strategies followed, information needed, and tools used. We found that developers put themselves in the role of end users by inspecting user interfaces. They try to avoid program comprehension, and employ recurring, structured comprehension strategies depending on work context. Further, we found that standards and experience facilitate comprehension. Program comprehension was considered a subtask of other maintenance tasks rather than a task by itself. We also found that face-to-face communication is preferred to documentation. Overall, our results show a gap between program comprehension research and practice as we did not observe any use of state of the art comprehension tools and developers seem to be unaware of them. Our findings call for further careful analysis and for reconsidering research agendas. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll31" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll31',31)">expand</a>

Based on the screen captured videos and the verbalization of the participants, we identified twenty different types of questions programmers ask when working with unfamiliar APIs, and provide new insights to the cause of the difficulties programmers encounter when answering questions about the use of APIs.

<span id="toHide34" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> PHP web applications routinely generate invalid HTML. Modern browsers silently correct HTML errors, but sometimes malformed pages render inconsistently, cause browser crashes, or expose security vulnerabilities. Fixing errors in generated pages is usually straightforward, but repairing the generating PHP program can be much harder. We observe that malformed HTML is often produced by incorrect "constant prints", i.e., statements that print string literals, and present two tools for automatically repairing such HTML generation errors. PHPQuickFix repairs simple bugs by statically analyzing individual prints. PHPRepair handles more general repairs using a dynamic approach. Based on a test suite, the property that all tests should produce their expected output is encoded as a string constraint over variables representing constant prints. Solving this constraint describes how constant prints must be modified to make all tests pass. Both tools were implemented as an Eclipse plugin and evaluated on PHP programs containing hundreds of HTML generation errors, most of which our tools were able to repair automatically. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll34" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll34',34)">expand</a>

Existing approaches suffer from two problems. First, dynamic specification miners require input that drives a program to generate common usage patterns. Second, existing approaches report false positives, that is, spurious warnings that mislead developers and reduce the practicability of the approach. We present a novel technique for dynamically mining and checking specifications without relying on existing input to drive a program and without reporting false positives. Our technique leverages automatically generated tests in two ways: Passing tests drive the program during specification mining, and failing test executions are checked against the mined specifications. The output are warnings that show with concrete test cases how the program violates commonly accepted specifications. Our implementation reports no false positives and 54 true positives in ten well-tested Java programs. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll35" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll35',35)">expand</a>

What is worse is that the violations are difficult to be fixed by the developers, which makes the automatic bug fixing techniques attractive solutions. The state of the art aims at automating the manual fixing process and can not provide any theoretical reasoning and guarantees. We provide an automatic approach that applies the well-studied control theory to guarantee the maximal preservation of the concurrency degree of the original code and no introduction of deadlocks. Under the hood, we reduce the problem of violation fixing to a constraint solving problem using the petri net model. Our evaluation on 13 subjects shows that the slowdown incurred by our patches is only 40% of that of the state of the art. With the deadlock-free guarantee, our patches incur moderate overhead (around 10%), which is a worthwhile cost for safety. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll36" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll36',36)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide37" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Developers often copy, or clone, code in order to reuse or modify functionality. When they do so, they also clone any bugs in the original code. Or, different developers may independently make the same mistake. As one example of a bug, multiple products in a product line may use a component in a similar wrong way. This paper makes two contributions. First, it presents an empirical study of cloned buggy code. In a large industrial product line, about 4% of the bugs are duplicated across more than one product or file. In three open source projects (the Linux kernel, the Git version control system, and the PostgreSQL database) we found 282, 33, and 33 duplicated bugs, respectively. Second, this paper presents a tool, CBCD, that searches for code that is semantically identical to given buggy code. CBCD tests graph isomorphism over the Program Dependency Graph (PDG) representation and uses four optimizations. We evaluated CBCD by searching for known clones of buggy code segments in the three projects and compared the results with text-based, token-based, and AST-based code clone detectors, namely Simian, CCFinder, Deckard, and CloneDR. The evaluation shows that CBCD is fast when searching for possible clones of the buggy code in a large system, and it is more precise for this purpose than the other code clone detectors. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll37" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll37',37)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide39" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Large and medium scale software projects often require a source code revision control (RC) system. Unfortunately, RC systems do not perform well with obliviousness and quantification found in aspect-oriented code. When classes are oblivious to aspects, so is the RC system, and the crosscutting effect of aspects is not tracked. In this work, we study this problem in the context of using AspectJ (a standard AOP language) with Subversion (a standard RC system). We describe scenarios where the crosscutting effect of aspects combined with the concurrent changes that RC supports can lead to inconsistent states of the code. The work contributes a mechanism that checks-in with the source code versions of crosscutting metadata for tracking the effect of aspects. Another contribution of this work is the implementation of a supporting Eclipse plug-in (named XRC) that extends the JDT, AJDT, and SVN plug-ins for Eclipse to provide crosscutting revision control (XRC) for aspect-oriented programming. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll39" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll39',39)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide41" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Merge conflicts cause software defects which if detected late may require expensive resolution. This is especially true when developers work too long without integrating concurrent changes, which in practice is common as integration generally occurs at check-in. Awareness of others' activities was proposed to help developers detect conflicts earlier. However, it requires developers to detect conflicts by themselves and may overload them with notifications, thus making detection harder. This paper presents a novel solution that continuously merges uncommitted and committed changes to create a background system that is analyzed, compiled, and tested to precisely and accurately detect conflicts on behalf of developers, before check-in. An empirical study confirms that our solution avoids overloading developers and improves early detection of conflicts over existing approaches. Similarly to what happened with continuous compilation, this introduces the case for continuous merging inside the IDE. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll41" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll41',41)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide42" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> In practice, it is common that a framework and its client programs evolve simultaneously. Thus, developers of client programs may need to migrate their programs to the new release of the framework when the framework evolves. As framework developers can hardly always guarantee backward compatibility during the evolution of a framework, migration of its client program is often time-consuming and error-prone. To facilitate this migration, researchers have proposed two categories of approaches to identification of framework evolution: operation-based approaches and matching-based approaches. To overcome the main limitations of the two categories of approaches, we propose a novel approach named HiMa, which is based on matching each pair of consecutive revisions recorded in the evolution history of the framework and aggregating revision-level rules to obtain framework-evolution rules. We implemented our HiMa approach as an Eclipse plug-in targeting at frameworks written in Java using SVN as the versioncontrol system. We further performed an experimental study on HiMa together with a state-of-art approach named AURA using six tasks based on three subject Java frameworks. Our experimental results demonstrate that HiMa achieves higher precision and higher recall than AURA in most circumstances and is never inferior to AURA in terms of precision and recall in any circumstances, although HiMa is computationally more costly than AURA. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll42" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll42',42)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide44" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Although popular text search engines allow users to retrieve similar web pages, source code search engines do not have this feature. Detecting similar applications is a notoriously difficult problem, since it implies that similar high-level requirements and their low-level implementations can be detected and matched automatically for different applications. We created a novel approach for automatically detecting Closely reLated ApplicatioNs (CLAN) that helps users detect similar applications for a given Java application. Our main contributions are an extension to a framework of relevance and a novel algorithm that computes a similarity index between Java applications using the notion of semantic layers that correspond to packages and class hierarchies. We have built CLAN and we conducted an experiment with 33 participants to evaluate CLAN and compare it with the closest competitive approach, MUDABlue. The results show with strong statistical significance that CLAN automatically detects similar applications from a large repository of 8,310 Java applications with a higher precision than MUDABlue. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll44" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll44',44)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide46" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> In the evolution of an operating system there is a continuing tension between the need to develop and test new features, and the need to provide a stable and secure execution environment to users. A compromise, adopted by the developers of the Linux kernel, is to release new versions, including bug fixes and new features, frequently, while maintaining some older "longterm" versions. This strategy raises the problem of how to identify bug fixing patches that are submitted to the current version but should be applied to the longterm versions as well. The current approach is to rely on the individual subsystem maintainers to forward patches that seem relevant to the maintainers of the longterm kernels. The reactivity and diligence of the maintainers, however, varies, and thus many important patches could be missed by this approach. </p> <p> In this paper, we propose an approach that automatically identifies bug fixing patches based on the changes and commit messages recorded in code repositories. We compare our approach with the keyword-based approach for identifying bug-fixing patches used in the literature, in the context of the Linux kernel. The results show that our approach can achieve a 53.19% improvement in recall as compared to keyword-based approaches, with similar precision. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll46" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll46',46)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide47" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Software clones have been widely studied in the recent literature and shown useful for finding bugs because inconsistent changes among clones in a clone group may indicate potential bugs. However, many inconsistent clone groups are not real bugs. The excessive number of false positives could easily impede broad adoption of clone-based bug detection approaches. </p> <p> In this work, we aim to improve the usability of clonebased bug detection tools by increasing the rate of true positives found when a developer analyzes anomaly reports. Our idea is to control the number of anomaly reports a user can see at a time and actively incorporate incremental user feedback to continually refine the anomaly reports. Our system first presents top few anomaly reports from the list of reports generated by a tool in its default ordering. Users then either accept or reject each of the reports. Based on the feedback, our system automatically and iteratively refines a classification model for anomalies and re-sorts the rest of the reports. Our goal is to present the true positives to the users earlier than the default ordering. The rationale of the idea is based on our observation that false positives among the inconsistent clone groups could share common features (in terms of code structure, programming patterns, etc.), and these features can be learned from the incremental user feedback. </p> <p> We evaluate our refinement process on three sets of clonebased anomaly reports from three large real programs: the Linux Kernel (C), Eclipse, and ArgoUML (Java), extracted by a clone-based anomaly detection tool. The results show that compared to the original ordering of bug reports, we can improve the rate of true positives found (i.e., true positives are found faster) by 11%, 87%, and 86% for Linux kernel, Eclipse, and ArgoUML, respectively. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll47" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll47',47)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide49" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> CSS is a widely used language for describing the presentation semantics of HTML elements on the web. The language has a number of characteristics, such as inheritance and cascading order, which makes maintaining CSS code a challenging task for web developers. As a result, it is common for unused rules to be accumulated over time. Despite these challenges, CSS analysis has not received much attention from the research community. We propose an automated technique to support styling code maintenance, which (1) analyzes the runtime relationship between the CSS rules and DOM elements of a given web application (2) detects unmatched and ineffective selectors, overridden declaration properties, and undefined class values. Our technique, implemented in an open source tool called CILLA, has a high precision and recall rate. The results of our case study, conducted on fifteen open source and industrial web-based systems, show an average of 60% unused CSS selectors in deployed applications, which points to the ubiquity of the problem. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll49" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll49',49)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide50" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> We exploit recent advances in analysis of graph topology to better understand software evolution, and to construct predictors that facilitate software development and maintenance. Managing an evolving, collaborative software system is a complex and expensive process, which still cannot ensure software reliability. Emerging techniques in graph mining have revolutionized the modeling of many complex systems and processes. We show how we can use a graph-based characterization of a software system to capture its evolution and facilitate development, by helping us estimate bug severity, prioritize refactoring efforts, and predict defect-prone releases. Our work consists of three main thrusts. First, we construct graphs that capture software structure at two different levels: (a) the product, i.e., source code and module level, and (b) the process, i.e., developer collaboration level. We identify a set of graph metrics that capture interesting properties of these graphs. Second, we study the evolution of eleven open source programs, including Firefox, Eclipse, MySQL, over the lifespan of the programs, typically a decade or more. Third, we show how our graph metrics can be used to construct predictors for bug severity, high-maintenance software parts, and failure-prone releases. Our work strongly suggests that using graph topology analysis concepts can open many actionable avenues in software engineering research and practice. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll50" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll50',50)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide51" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> The paper presents an adaptive approach to perform impact analysis from a given change request to source code. Given a textual change request (e.g., a bug report), a single snapshot (release) of source code, indexed using Latent Semantic Indexing, is used to estimate the impact set. Should additional contextual information be available, the approach configures the best-fit combination to produce an improved impact set. Contextual information includes the execution trace and an initial source code entity verified for change. Combinations of information retrieval, dynamic analysis, and data mining of past source code commits are considered. The research hypothesis is that these combinations help counter the precision or recall deficit of individual techniques and improve the overall accuracy. The tandem operation of the three techniques sets it apart from other related solutions. Automation along with the effective utilization of two key sources of developer knowledge, which are often overlooked in impact analysis at the change request level, is achieved. </p> <p> To validate our approach, we conducted an empirical evaluation on four open source software systems. A benchmark consisting of a number of maintenance issues, such as feature requests and bug fixes, and their associated source code changes was established by manual examination of these systems and their change history. Our results indicate that there are combinations formed from the augmented developer contextual information that show statistically significant improvement over stand-alone approaches. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll51" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll51',51)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide52" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Spreadsheets are often used in business, for simple tasks, as well as for mission critical tasks such as finance or forecasting. Similar to software, some spreadsheets are of better quality than others, for instance with respect to usability, maintainability or reliability. In contrast with software however, spreadsheets are rarely checked, tested or certified. In this paper, we aim at developing an approach for detecting smells that indicate weak points in a spreadsheet's design. To that end we first study code smells and transform these code smells to their spreadsheet counterparts. We then present an approach to detect the smells, and communicate located smells to spreadsheet users with data flow diagrams. We analyzed occurrences of these smells in the Euses corpus. Furthermore we conducted ten case studies in an industrial setting. The results of the evaluation indicate that smells can indeed reveal weaknesses in a spreadsheet's design, and that data flow diagrams are an appropriate way to show those weaknesses. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll52" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll52',52)">expand</a>

Recent work has applied causal inference to eliminate or reduce control and data flow dependence confounding bias in statement-level statistical debuggers. The result is improved effectiveness. This is encouraging but motivates two novel questions: (1) how can causal inference be applied in predicate-level statistical debuggers and (2) what other biases can be eliminated or reduced. Here we address both questions by providing a model that eliminates or reduces control flow dependence and failure flow confounding bias within predicate-level statistical debuggers. We present empirical results demonstrating that our model significantly improves the effectiveness of a variety of predicate-level statistical debuggers, including those that eliminate or reduce only a single source of confounding bias. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll55" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll55',55)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide56" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> A recent survey conducted among developers of the Apache, Eclipse, and Mozilla projects showed that the ability to recreate field failures is considered of fundamental importance when investigating bug reports. Unfortunately, the information typically contained in a bug report, such as memory dumps or call stacks, is usually insufficient for recreating the problem. Even more advanced approaches for gathering field data and help in-house debugging tend to collect either too little information, and be ineffective, or too much information, and be inefficient. To address these issues, we present BugRedux, a novel general approach for in-house debugging of field failures. BugRedux aims to synthesize, using execution data collected in the field, executions that mimic the observed field failures. We define several instances of BugRedux that collect different types of execution data and perform, through an empirical study, a cost-benefit analysis of the approach and its variations. In the study, we apply BugRedux to 16 failures of 14 real-world programs. Our results are promising in that they show that it is possible to synthesize in-house executions that reproduce failures observed in the field using a suitable set of execution data. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll56" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll56',56)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide57" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> During the process of developing and maintaining a complex software system, developers pose detailed questions about the runtime behavior of the system. Source code views offer strictly limited insights, so developers often turn to tools like debuggers to inspect and interact with the running system. Unfortunately, traditional debuggers focus on the runtime stack as the key abstraction to support debugging operations, though the questions developers pose often have more to do with objects and their interactions. We propose object-centric debugging as an alternative approach to interacting with a running software system. We show how, by focusing on objects as the key abstraction, natural debugging operations can be defined to answer developer questions related to runtime behavior. We present a running prototype of an object-centric debugger, and demonstrate, with the help of a series of examples, how object-centric debugging offers more effective support for many typical developer tasks than a traditional stack-oriented debugger. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll57" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll57',57)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide59" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Pair Programming (PP) requires close collaboration and mutual engagement. Most existing empirical studies of PP do not focus on developers&#8217; behaviour during PP sessions, and focus instead on the effects of PP such as productivity. However, disengagement, where a developer is not focusing on solving the task or understanding the problem and allows their partner to work by themselves, can hinder collaboration between developers and have a negative effect on their performance. This paper reports on an empirical study that investigates disengagement. Twenty-one industrial pair programming sessions were video and audio recorded and qualitatively analysed to investigate circumstances that lead to disengagement. We identified five reasons for disengagement: interruptions during the collaboration, the way the work is divided, the simplicity of the task involved, social pressure on inexperienced pair programmers, and time pressure. Our findings suggest that disengagement is sometimes acceptable and agreed upon between the developers in order to speed up problem solving. However, we also found episodes of disengagement where developers &#8220;drop out&#8221; of their PP sessions and are not able to follow their partner&#8217;s work nor contribute to the task at hand, thus losing the expected benefits of pairing. Analysis of sessions conducted under similar circumstances but where mutual engagement was sustained identified three behaviours that help to maintain engagement: encouraging the novice to drive, verbalisation and feedback, and asking for clarification. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll59" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll59',59)">expand</a>

The system uses ambient awareness technologies, providing a separate, easily perceived communication channel distinct from standard team workflow. Multiple system configurations and behaviours were evaluated. An evaluation of the system showed that, while there was no significant change in the proportion of build breakages, the overall number of builds increased substantially, and the duration of broken builds decreased. Team members also reported an increased sense of awareness of, and responsibility for, broken builds and some noted the system dramatically changed their perception of the build process making them more cognisant of broken builds. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll60" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll60',60)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide61" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> To survive and succeed, software projects need to attract and retain contributors. We model the individual's chances to become a valuable contributor through their capacity, willingness, and the opportunity to contribute at the time of joining. Using issue tracking data of Mozilla and Gnome, we find that the probability for a new joiner to become a Long Term Contributor (LTC) is associated with her willingness and environment. Specifically, during their first month, future LTCs tend to be more active and show more community-oriented attitude than other joiners. Joiners who start by commenting on instead of reporting an issue or ones who succeed to get at least one reported issue to be fixed, more than double their odds of becoming an LTC. The macro-climate with high project relative sociality and the micro-climate with a large, productive, and clustered peer group increase the odds. On the contrary, the macro-climate with high project popularity and the micro-climate with low attention from peers reduce the odds. This implies that the interaction between individual's attitude and project's climate are associated with the odds that an individual would become a valuable contributor or disengage from the project. Our findings may provide a basis for empirical approaches to design a better community architecture and to improve the experience of contributors. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll61" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll61',61)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide62" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> A considerable part of software systems is comprised of functions that support the main modules, such as array or string manipulation and basic math computation. These auxiliary functions are usually considered less complex, and thus tend to receive less attention from developers. However, failures in these functions might propagate to more critical modules, thereby affecting the system's overall reliability. Given the complementary role of auxiliary functions, a question that arises is whether agile practices, such as pair programming and test-first programming, can improve their correctness without affecting time-to-market. This paper presents an empirical assessment comparing the application of these agile practices with more traditional approaches. Our study comprises independent experiments of pair versus solo programming, and test-first versus test-last programming. The first study involved 85 novice programmers who applied both traditional and agile approaches in the development of six auxiliary functions within three different domains. Our results suggest that the agile practices might bring benefits in this context. In particular, pair programmers delivered correct implementations much more often, and test-first programming encouraged the production of larger and higher coverage test sets. On the downside, the main experiment showed that both practices significantly increase total development time. A replication of the test-first experiment with professional developers shows similar results. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll62" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll62',62)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide64" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Following the ``convention over configuration" paradigm, model-driven development (MDD) generates code to implement the ``default'' behaviour that has been specified by a template separate from the input model, reducing the decision effort of developers. For flexibility, users of MDD are allowed to customise the model and the generated code in parallel. A synchronisation of changed model or code is maintained by reflecting them on the other end of the code generation, as long as the traceability is unchanged. However, such invariant traceability between corresponding model and code elements can be violated either when (a) users of MDD protect custom changes from the generated code, or when (b) developers of MDD change the template for generating the default behaviour. A mismatch between user and template code is inevitable as they evolve for their own purposes. In this paper, we propose a two-layered invariant traceability framework that reduces the number of mismatches through bidirectional transformations. On top of existing vertical (model&lt;-&gt;code) synchronisations between a model and the template code, a horizontal (code&lt;-&gt;code) synchronisation between user and template code is supported, aligning the changes in both directions. Our blinkit tool is evaluated using the data set available from the CVS repositories of a MDD project: Eclipse MDT/GMF. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll64" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll64',64)">expand</a>

In particular, static analyses are required that operate directly on the models. In this article, we present an approach for slicing Simulink Models using dependence graphs and demonstrate its efficiency using case studies from the automotive and avionics domain. With slicing, the complexity of a model can be reduced for a given point of interest by removing unrelated model elements, thus paving the way for subsequent static quality assurance methods. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll65" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll65',65)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide66" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Model Transformation is considered an important enabling factor for Model Driven Development. Transformations can be applied not only for the generation of new models from existing ones, but also for the consistent co-evolution of software artifacts that pertain to various phases of software lifecycle such as requirement models, design documents and source code. Furthermore, it is often common in practical scenarios to apply such transformations repeatedly and frequently; an activity that can take a significant amount of time and resources, especially when the affected models are complex and highly interdependent. In this paper, we discuss a novel approach for deriving incremental model transformations by the partial evaluation of original model transformation programs. Partial evaluation involves pre-computing parts of the transformation program based on known model dependencies and the type of the applied model change. Such pre-evaluation allows for significant reduction of transformation time in large and complex model repositories. To evaluate the approach, we have implemented QvtMix, a prototype partial evaluator for the Query, View and Transformation Operational Mappings (QVT-OM) language. The experiments indicate that the proposed technique can be used for significantly improving the performance of repetitive applications of model transformations. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll66" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll66',66)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide69" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> With modern multi-core architectures, web applications are usually configured to serve multiple requests simultaneously by spawning multiple instances. These instances may access the same external resources such as database tables and files. Such contentions may become severe during peak time, leading to violations of atomicity business logic. In this paper, we propose a novel static analysis that detects atomicity violations of external operations for server side scripts. The analysis differs from traditional atomicity violation detection techniques by focusing on external resources instead of shared memory. It consists of three components. The first one is an interprocedural and path-sensitive resource identity analysis that determines whether multiple operations access the same external resource, which is critical to identifying contentions. The second component infers pairs of external operations that should be executed atomically. Finally, violations are detected by reasoning about serializability of interleaved atomic pairs. Experimental results show that the analysis is highly effective in detecting atomicity violations in real-world web apps. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll69" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll69',69)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide70" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Validating code handling exceptional behavior is difficult, particularly when dealing with external resources that may be noisy and unreliable, as it requires: 1) the systematic exploration of the space of exceptions that may be thrown by the external resources, and 2) the setup of the context to trigger specific patterns of exceptions. In this work we present an approach that addresses those difficulties by performing an exhaustive amplification of the space of exceptional behavior associated with an external resource that is exercised by a test suite. Each amplification attempts to expose a program exception handling construct to new behavior by mocking an external resource so that it returns normally or throws an exception following a predefined pattern. Our assessment of the approach indicates that it can be fully automated, is powerful enough to detect 65% of the faults reported in the bug reports of this kind, and is precise enough that 77% of the detected anomalies correspond to faults fixed by the developers. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll70" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll70',70)">expand</a>

Unlike existing techniques to locate potential deadlock cycles from an execution, it iteratively prunes lock dependencies that each has no incoming or outgoing edge. Combining with a novel thread-specific strategy, it dramatically shrinks the size of lock dependency set for cycle detection, improving the efficiency and scalability of such a detection significantly. In the real deadlock confirmation phase, it uses a new strategy to actively schedule threads of an execution against the whole set of potential deadlock cycles. We have implemented a prototype and evaluated it on large-scale C/C++ programs.

Existing architecture-implementation mapping approaches are not sufficient due to a variety of reasons, including lack of support for change management and mapping of behavioral architecture specification.

Its contribution includes deep separation of generated and non-generated code, an architecture change model, architecture-based code regeneration, and architecture change notification. The approach is implemented in ArchStudio 4, an Eclipse-based architecture development environment.

<span id="toHide75" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> The software architectures of business, mission, or safety critical systems must be carefully designed to balance an exacting set of quality concerns describing characteristics such as security, reliability, and performance. Unfortunately, software architectures tend to degrade over time as maintainers modify the system without understanding the underlying architectural decisions. Although this problem can be mitigated by manually tracing architectural decisions into the code, the cost and effort required to do this can be prohibitively expensive. In this paper we therefore present a novel approach for automating the construction of traceability links for architectural tactics. Our approach utilizes machine learning methods and lightweight structural analysis to detect tactic-related classes. The detected tactic-related classes are then mapped to a Tactic Traceability Information Model. We train our trace algorithm using code extracted from fifteen performance-centric and safety-critical open source software systems and then evaluate it against the Apache Hadoop framework. Our results show that automatically generated traceability links can support software maintenance activities while preserving architectural qualities. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll75" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll75',75)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide77" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Build process is crucial in software development. However, the analysis support for build code is still limited. In this paper, we present SYMake, an infrastructure and tool for the analysis of build code in make. Due to the dynamic nature of make language, it is challenging to understand and maintain complex Makefiles. SYMake provides a symbolic evaluation algorithm that processes Makefiles and produces a symbolic dependency graph (SDG), which represents the build dependencies (i.e. rules) among files via commands. During the symbolic evaluation, for each resulting string value in an SDG that represents a part of a file name or a command in a rule, SYMake provides also an acyclic graph (called T-model) to represent its symbolic evaluation trace. We have used SYMake to develop algorithms and a tool 1) to detect several types of code smells and errors in Makefiles, and 2) to support build code refactoring, e.g. renaming a variable/target even if its name is fragmented and built from multiple substrings. Our empirical evaluation for SYMake's renaming on several real-world systems showed its high accuracy in entity renaming. Our controlled experiment showed that with SYMake, developers were able to understand Makefiles better and to detect more code smells as well as to perform refactoring more accurately. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll77" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll77',77)">expand</a>

Constraint solving aims to find solutions to such problems efficiently and automatically. Current constraint solvers are monolithic in design, accepting a broad range of problems. The cost of this convenience is a complex architecture, inhibiting efficiency, extensibility and scalability. Solver components are also tightly coupled with complex restrictions on their configuration, making automated generation of solvers difficult. </p> <p> We describe a novel, automated, model-driven approach to generating efficient solvers tailored to individual problems and present some results from applying the approach. The main contribution of this work is a solver generation framework called Dominion, which analyses a problem and, based on its characteristics, generates a solver using components chosen from a library. The key benefit of this approach is the ability to solve larger and more difficult problems as a result of applying finer-grained optimisations and using specialised techniques as required. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll78" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll78',78)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide79" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Software Product Line (SPL) engineering is a software engineering paradigm that exploits the commonality between similar software products to reduce life cycle costs and time-to-market. Many SPLs are critical and would benefit from efficient verification through model checking. Model checking SPLs is more difficult than for single systems, since the number of different products is potentially huge. In previous work, we introduced Featured Transition Systems (FTS), a formal, compact representation of SPL behaviour, and provided efficient algorithms to verify FTS. Yet, we still face the state explosion problem, like any model checking-based verification. Model abstraction is the most relevant answer to state explosion. In this paper, we define a novel simulation relation for FTS and provide an algorithm to compute it. We extend well-known simulation preservation properties to FTS and thus lay the theoretical foundations for abstraction-based model checking of SPLs. We evaluate our approach by comparing the cost of FTS-based simulation and abstraction with respect to product-by-product methods. Our results show that FTS are a solid foundation for simulation-based model checking of SPL. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll79" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll79',79)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide81" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Dynamic invariant analysis identifies likely properties over variables from observed program traces. These properties can aid programmers in refactoring, documenting, and debugging tasks by making dynamic patterns visible statically. Two useful forms of invariants involve relations among polynomials over program variables and relations among array variables. Current dynamic analysis methods support such invariants in only very limited forms. We combine mathematical techniques that have not previously been applied to this problem, namely equation solving, polyhedra construction, and SMT solving, to bring new capabilities to dynamic invariant detection. Using these methods, we show how to find equalities and inequalities among nonlinear polynomials over program variables, and linear relations among array variables of multiple dimensions. Preliminary experiments on 24 mathematical algorithms and an implementation of AES encryption provide evidence that the approach is effective at finding these invariants. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll81" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll81',81)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide82" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> As the prevailing programming model of enterprise applications is becoming more declarative, programmers are spending an increasing amount of their time and efforts writing and maintaining metadata, such as XML or annotations. Although metadata is a cornerstone of modern software, automatic bug finding tools cannot ensure that metadata maintains its correctness during refactoring and enhancement. To address this shortcoming, this paper presents metadata invariants, a new abstraction that codifies various naming and typing relationships between metadata and the main source code of a program. We reify this abstraction as a domain-specific language. We also introduce algorithms to infer likely metadata invariants and to apply them to check metadata correctness in the presence of program evolution. We demonstrate how metadata invariant checking can help ensure that metadata remains consistent and correct during program evolution; it finds metadata-related inconsistencies and recommends how they should be corrected. Similar to static bug finding tools, a metadata invariant checker identifies metadata-related bugs as a program is being refactored and enhanced. Because metadata is omnipresent in modern software applications, our approach can help ensure the overall consistency and correctness of software as it evolves. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll82" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll82',82)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide83" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Missing requirements are known to be among the major causes of software failure. They often result from a natural inclination to conceive over-ideal systems where the software-to-be and its environment always behave as expected. Obstacle analysis is a goal-anchored form of risk analysis whereby exceptional conditions that may obstruct system goals are identified, assessed and resolved to produce complete requirements. Various techniques have been proposed for identifying obstacle conditions systematically. Among these, the formal ones have limited applicability or are costly to automate. This paper describes a tool-supported technique for generating a set of obstacle conditions guaranteed to be complete and consistent with respect to the known domain properties. The approach relies on a novel combination of model checking and learning technologies. Obstacles are iteratively learned from counterexample and witness traces produced by model checking against a goal and converted into positive and negative examples, respectively. A comparative evaluation is provided with respect to published results on the manual derivation of obstacles in a real safety-critical system for which failures have been reported. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll83" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll83',83)">expand</a>

In this paper, we present a technique for amplifying the effect of existing test suites using a lightweight symbolic execution mechanism, which thoroughly checks all sensitive operations (e.g., pointer dereferences) executed by the test suite for errors, and explores additional paths around sensitive operations. We implemented this technique in a prototype system called ZESTI (Zero-Effort Symbolic Test Improvement), and applied it to three open-source code bases&#8212;GNU Coreutils, libdwarf and readelf&#8212;where it found 52 previously unknown bugs, many of which are out of reach of standard symbolic execution.

<span id="toHide86" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Testing multithreaded code is hard and expensive. Each multithreaded unit test creates two or more threads, each executing one or more methods on shared objects of the class under test. Such unit tests can be generated at random, but basic generation produces tests that are either slow or do not trigger concurrency bugs. Worse, such tests have many false alarms, which require human effort to filter out. We present BALLERINA, a novel technique for automatic generation of efficient multithreaded random tests that effectively trigger concurrency bugs. BALLERINA makes tests efficient by having only two threads, each executing a single, randomly selected method. BALLERINA increases chances that such a simple parallel code finds bugs by appending it to more complex, randomly generated sequential code. We also propose a clustering technique to reduce the manual effort in inspecting failures of automatically generated multithreaded tests. We evaluate BALLERINA on 14 real-world bugs from 6 popular codebases: Groovy, Java JDK, jFreeChart, Log4j, Lucene, and Pool. The experiments show that tests generated by BALLERINA can find bugs on average 2X-10X faster than various configurations of basic random generation, and our clustering technique reduces the number of inspected failures on average 4X-8X. Using BALLERINA, we found three previously unknown bugs in Apache Pool and Log4j, one of which was already confirmed and fixed. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll86" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll86',86)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide87" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Most test suite reduction techniques aim to select, from a given test suite, a minimal representative subset of test cases that retains the same code coverage as the suite. Empirical studies have shown, however, that test suites reduced in this manner may lose fault detection capability. Techniques have been proposed to retain certain redundant test cases in the reduced test suite so as to reduce the loss in fault-detection capability, but these still do concede some degree of loss. Thus, these techniques may be applicable only in cases where loose demands are placed on the upper limit of loss in fault-detection capability. In this work we present an on-demand test suite reduction approach, which attempts to select a representative subset satisfying the same test requirements as an initial test suite conceding at most l% loss in fault-detection capability for at least c% of the instances in which it is applied. Our technique collects statistics about loss in fault-detection capability at the level of individual statements and models the problem of test suite reduction as an integer linear programming problem. We have evaluated our approach in the contexts of three scenarios in which it might be used. Our results show that most test suites reduced by our approach satisfy given fault detection capability demands, and that the approach compares favorably with an existing test suite reduction approach. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll87" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll87',87)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide89" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Web application programmers must be aware of a wide range of potential security risks. Although the most common pitfalls are well described and categorized in the literature, it remains a challenging task to ensure that all guidelines are followed. For this reason, it is desirable to construct automated tools that can assist the programmers in the application development process by detecting weaknesses. Many vulnerabilities are related to web application code that stores references to application state in the generated HTML documents to work around the statelessness of the HTTP protocol. In this paper, we show that such client-state manipulation vulnerabilities are amenable to tool supported detection. We present a static analysis for the widely used frameworks Java Servlets, JSP, and Struts. Given a web application archive as input, the analysis identifies occurrences of client state and infers the information flow between the client state and the shared application state on the server. This makes it possible to check how client-state manipulation performed by malicious users may affect the shared application state and cause leakage or modifications of sensitive information. The warnings produced by the tool help the application programmer identify vulnerabilities. Moreover, the inferred information can be applied to configure a security filter that automatically guards against attacks. Experiments on a collection of open source web applications indicate that the static analysis is able to effectively help the programmer prevent client-state manipulation vulnerabilities. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll89" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll89',89)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide90" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Integer overflow bugs in C and C++ programs are difficult to track down and may lead to fatal errors or exploitable vulnerabilities. Although a number of tools for finding these bugs exist, the situation is complicated because not all overflows are bugs. Better tools need to be constructed---but a thorough understanding of the issues behind these errors does not yet exist. We developed IOC, a dynamic checking tool for integer overflows, and used it to conduct the first detailed empirical study of the prevalence and patterns of occurrence of integer overflows in C and C++ code. Our results show that intentional uses of wraparound behaviors are more common than is widely believed; for example, there are over 200 distinct locations in the SPEC CINT2000 benchmarks where overflow occurs. Although many overflows are intentional, a large number of accidental overflows also occur. Orthogonal to programmers' intent, overflows are found in both well-defined and undefined flavors. Applications executing undefined operations can be, and have been, broken by improvements in compiler optimizations. Looking beyond SPEC, we found and reported undefined integer overflows in SQLite, PostgreSQL, SafeInt, GNU MPC and GMP, Firefox, GCC, LLVM, Python, BIND, and OpenSSL; many of these have since been fixed. Our results show that integer overflow issues in C and C++ are subtle and complex, that they are common even in mature, widely used programs, and that they are widely misunderstood by developers. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll90" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll90',90)">expand</a>

The study of vulnerability life cycles can help in the development, deployment, and maintenance of software systems. It can also help in designing future security policies and conducting audits of past incidents. Furthermore, such an analysis can help customers to assess the security risks associated with software products of different vendors. In this paper, we conduct an exploratory measurement study of a large software vulnerability data set containing 46310 vulnerabilities disclosed since 1988 till 2011. We investigate vulnerabilities along following seven dimensions: (1) phases in the life cycle of vulnerabilities, (2) evolution of vulnerabilities over the years, (3) functionality of vulnerabilities, (4) access requirement for exploitation of vulnerabilities, (5) risk level of vulnerabilities, (6) software vendors, and (7) software products. Our exploratory analysis uncovers several statistically significant findings that have important implications for software development and deployment. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll91" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll91',91)">expand</a>

While such documentation is known to be of great utility, it is burdensome to create and can be incomplete, out of date, or not representative of actual practice. We present an automatic technique for mining and synthesizing succinct and representative human-readable documentation of program interfaces. Our algorithm is based on a combination of path sensitive dataflow analysis, clustering, and pattern abstraction. It produces output in the form of well-typed program snippets which document initialization, method calls, assignments, looping constructs, and exception handling. In a human study involving over 150 participants, 82% of our generated examples were found to be at least as good at human-written instances and 94% were strictly preferred to state of the art code search. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll93" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll93',93)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide95" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Software reuse through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) is an integral part of software development. The functionality offered by an API is not always accessed uniformly throughout the lifetime of a client program. We propose Temporal API Usage Pattern Mining to detect API usage patterns in terms of their time of introduction into client programs. We detect concepts as distinct groups of API functionality from the change history of a client program. We locate those concepts in the client change history and detect temporal usage patterns, where a pattern contains a set of concepts that were added into the client program in a specific temporal order. We investigated the properties of temporal API usage patterns through a multiple-case study of three APIs and their use in up to 19 client software projects. Our technique was able to detect a number of valuable patterns in two out of three of the APIs investigated. Further investigation showed some patterns to be relatively consistent between clients, produced by multiple developers, and not trivially derivable from program structure or API documentation. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll95" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll95',95)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide96" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Application Programming Interface (API) documents are a typical way of describing legal usage of reusable software libraries, thus facilitating software reuse. However, even with such documents, developers often overlook some documents and build software systems that are inconsistent with the legal usage of those libraries. Existing software verification tools require formal specifications (such as code contracts), and therefore cannot directly verify the legal usage described in natural language text of API documents against the code using that library. However, in practice, most libraries do not come with formal specifications, thus hindering tool-based verification. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to infer formal specifications from natural language text of API documents. Our evaluation results show that our approach achieves an average of 92% precision and 93% recall in identifying sentences that describe code contracts from more than 2500 sentences of API documents. Furthermore, our results show that our approach has an average 83% accuracy in inferring specifications from over 1600 sentences describing code contracts. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll96" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll96',96)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide98" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Programmers extensively use application programming interfaces (APIs) to leverage existing libraries and frameworks. However, correctly and efficiently choosing and using APIs from unfamiliar libraries and frameworks is still a non-trivial task. Programmers often need to ruminate on API documentations (that are often incomplete) or inspect code examples (that are often absent) to learn API usage patterns. Recently, various techniques have been proposed to alleviate this problem by creating API summarizations, mining code examples, or showing common API call sequences. However, few techniques focus on recommending API parameters. </p> <p> In this paper, we propose an automated technique, called Precise, to address this problem. Differing from common code completion systems, Precise mines existing code bases, uses an abstract usage instance representation for each API usage example, and then builds a parameter usage database. Upon a request, Precise queries the database for abstract usage instances in similar contexts and generates parameter candidates by concretizing the instances adaptively. </p> <p> The experimental results show that our technique is more general and applicable than existing code completion systems, specially, 64% of the parameter recommendations are useful and 53% of the recommendations are exactly the same as the actual parameters needed. We have also performed a user study to show our technique is useful in practice. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll98" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll98',98)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide99" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Natural languages like English are rich, complex, and powerful. The highly creative and graceful use of languages like English and Tamil, by masters like Shakespeare and Avvaiyar, can certainly delight and inspire. But in practice, given cognitive constraints and the exigencies of daily life, most human utterances are far simpler and much more repetitive and predictable. In fact, these utterances can be very usefully modeled using modern statistical methods. This fact has led to the phenomenal success of statistical approaches to speech recognition, natural language translation, question-answering, and text mining and comprehension. We begin with the conjecture that most software is also natural, in the sense that it is created by humans at work, with all the attendant constraints and limitations---and thus, like natural language, it is also likely to be repetitive and predictable. We then proceed to ask whether a) code can be usefully modeled by statistical language models and b) such models can be leveraged to support software engineers. Using the widely adopted n-gram model, we provide empirical evidence supportive of a positive answer to both these questions. We show that code is also very repetitive, and in fact even more so than natural languages. As an example use of the model, we have developed a simple code completion engine for Java that, despite its simplicity, already improves Eclipse's completion capability. We conclude the paper by laying out a vision for future research in this area. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll99" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll99',99)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide100" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Rapid prototypes are often developed early in the software development process in order to help project stakeholders explore ideas for possible features, and to discover, analyze, and specify requirements for the project. As prototypes are typically thrown-away following the initial analysis phase, it is imperative for them to be created quickly with little cost and effort. Tool support for finding and reusing components from open-source repositories offers a major opportunity to reduce this manual effort. In this paper, we present a system for rapid prototyping that facilitates software reuse by mining feature descriptions and source code from open-source repositories. Our system identifies and recommends features and associated source code modules that are relevant to the software product under development. The modules are selected such that they implement as many of the desired features as possible while exhibiting the lowest possible levels of external coupling. We conducted a user study to evaluate our approach and results indicated that it returned packages that implemented more features and were considered more relevant than the state-of-the-art approach. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll100" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll100',100)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide101" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Code completion menus have replaced standalone API browsers for most developers because they are more tightly integrated into the development workflow. Refinements to the code completion menu that incorporate additional sources of information have similarly been shown to be valuable, even relative to standalone counterparts offering similar functionality. In this paper, we describe active code completion, an architecture that allows library developers to introduce interactive and highly-specialized code generation interfaces, called palettes, directly into the editor. Using several empirical methods, we examine the contexts in which such a system could be useful, describe the design constraints governing the system architecture as well as particular code completion interfaces, and design one such system, named Graphite, for the Eclipse Java development environment. Using Graphite, we implement a palette for writing regular expressions as our primary example and conduct a small pilot study. In addition to showing the feasibility of this approach, it provides further evidence in support of the claim that integrating specialized code completion interfaces directly into the editor is valuable to professional developers. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll101" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll101',101)">expand</a>

The choice of test oracle can significantly impact the effectiveness of the testing process. However, despite the prevalence of tools that support the selection of test inputs, little work exists for supporting oracle creation. In this work, we propose a method of supporting test oracle creation. This method automatically selects the oracle data &#226; the set of variables monitored during testing&#226;for expected value test oracles. This approach is based on the use of mutation analysis to rank variables in terms of fault-finding effectiveness, thus automating the selection of the oracle data. Experiments over four industrial examples demonstrate that our method may be a cost-effective approach for producing small, effective oracle data, with fault finding improvements over current industrial best practice of up to 145.8% observed. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll103" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll103',103)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide104" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Mention test case, and it conjures up image of a script or a program that exercises a system under test. In industrial practice, however, test cases often start out as steps described in natural language. These are essentially directions a human tester needs to follow to interact with an application, exercising a given scenario. Since tests need to be executed repeatedly, such manual tests then have to go through test automation to create scripts or programs out of them. Test automation can be expensive in programmer time. We describe a technique to automate test automation. The input to our technique is a sequence of steps written in natural language, and the output is a sequence of procedure calls with accompanying parameters that can drive the application without human intervention. The technique is based on looking at the natural language test steps as consisting of segments that describe actions on targets, except that there can be ambiguity in the action itself, in the order in which segments occur, and in the specification of the target of the action. The technique resolves this ambiguity by backtracking, until it can synthesize a successful sequence of calls. We present an evaluation of our technique on professionally created manual test cases for two open-source web applications as well as a proprietary enterprise application. Our technique could automate over 82% of the steps contained in these test cases with no human intervention, indicating that the technique can reduce the cost of test automation quite effectively. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll104" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll104',104)">expand</a>

Existing approaches either maintain the exact shared read-write linkages with a large runtime overhead or use exponential off-line algorithms to search for a feasible interleaved execution. In this paper, we propose Stride, a hybrid solution that records the bounded shared memory access linkages at runtime and infers an equivalent interleaving in polynomial time, under the sequential consistency assumption. The recording scheme eliminates the need for synchronizing the shared read operations, which results in a significant overhead reduction. Comparing to the previous state-of-the-art approach of deterministic replay, Stride reduces, on average, 2.5 times of runtime overhead and produces, on average, 3.88 times smaller logs. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll105" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll105',105)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide106" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Software configurability has many benefits, but it also makes programs much harder to test, as in the worst case the program must be tested under every possible configuration. One potential remedy to this problem is combinatorial interaction testing (CIT), in which typically the developer selects a strength t and then computes a covering array containing all t-way configuration option combinations. However, in a prior study we showed that several programs have important high-strength interactions (combinations of a subset of configuration options) that CIT is highly unlikely to generate in practice. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm called interaction tree discovery (iTree) that aims to identify sets of configurations to test that are smaller than those generated by CIT, while also including important high-strength interactions missed by practical applications of CIT. On each iteration of iTree, we first use low-strength CIT to test the program under a set of configurations, and then apply machine learning techniques to discover new interactions that are potentially responsible for any new coverage seen. By repeating this process, iTree builds up a set of configurations likely to contain key high-strength interactions. We evaluated iTree by comparing the coverage it achieves versus covering arrays and randomly generated configuration sets. Our results strongly suggest that iTree can identify high-coverage sets of configurations more effectively than traditional CIT or random sampling. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll106" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll106',106)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide108" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Distributed systems often contain many behaviorally similar processes, which are conveniently grouped into classes. In system modeling, it is common to specify such systems by describing the class level behavior, instead of object level behavior. While there have been techniques that mine specifications of such distributed systems from their execution traces, these methods only mine object-level specifications involving concrete process objects. This leads to specifications which are large, hard to comprehend, and sensitive to simple changes in the system (such as the number of objects). </p> <p> In this paper, we develop a class level specification mining framework for distributed systems. A specification that describes interaction snippets between various processes in a distributed system forms a natural and intuitive way to document their behavior. Our mining method groups together such interactions between behaviorally similar processes, and presents a mined specification involving "symbolic" Message Sequence Charts. Our experiments indicate that our mined symbolic specifications are significantly smaller than mined concrete specifications, while at the same time achieving better precision and recall. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll108" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll108',108)">expand</a>

Several techniques have been proposed to find violations of such protocols based on mined specifications. However, existing techniques either focus on single-object protocols or on particular kinds of bugs, such as missing method calls. There is no practical technique to find multi-object protocol bugs without a priori known specifications. In this paper, we combine a dynamic analysis that infers multi-object protocols and a static checker of API usage constraints into a fully automatic protocol conformance checker. The combined system statically detects illegal uses of an API without human-written specifications. Our approach finds 41 bugs and code smells in mature, real-world Java programs with a true positive rate of 51%. Furthermore, we show that the analysis reveals bugs not found by state of the art approaches. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll109" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll109',109)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide110" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Contracts are a popular declarative specification technique to describe the behavior of stateful components in terms of pre/post conditions and invariants. Since each operation is specified separately in terms of an abstract implementation, it may be hard to understand and validate the resulting component behavior from contracts in terms of method interactions. In particular, properties expressed through algebraic axioms, which specify the effect of sequences of operations, require complex theorem proving techniques to be validated. In this paper, we propose an automatic small-scope based approach to synthesize incomplete behavioral abstractions for contracts expressed in the JFSL notation. The proposed abstraction technique enables the possibility to check that the contract behavior is coherent with behavioral properties expressed as axioms of an algebraic specifications. We assess the applicability of our approach by showing how the synthesis methodology can be applied to some classes of contract-based artifacts like specifications of data abstractions and requirement engineering models. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll110" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll110',110)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide111" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Client-side computation in web applications is becoming increasingly common due to the popularity of powerful client-side programming languages such as JavaScript. Client-side computation is commonly used to improve an application&#226;s responsiveness by validating user inputs before they are sent to the server. In this paper, we present an analysis technique for checking if a client-side input validation function conforms to a given policy. In our approach, input validation policies are expressed using two regular expressions, one specifying the maximum policy (the upper bound for the set of inputs that should be allowed) and the other specifying the minimum policy (the lower bound for the set of inputs that should be allowed). Using our analysis we can identify two types of errors 1) the input validation function accepts an input that is not permitted by the maximum policy, or 2) the input validation function rejects an input that is permitted by the minimum policy. We implemented our analysis using dynamic slicing to automatically extract the input validation functions from web applications and using automata-based string analysis to analyze the extracted functions. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach is effective in finding errors in input validation functions that we collected from real-world applications and from tutorials and books for teaching JavaScript. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll111" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll111',111)">expand</a>

Both cut across the duality global/national and each has altered the economic and political landscapes for respectively financial elites and social activists. Using these two cases helps illuminate the very diverse ways in which the growth of electronic networks partially transforms existing politico-economic orderings. They are extreme cases, one marked by hypermobility and the other by physical immobility. But they show us that each is only partly so: financial electronic networks are subject to particular types of embeddedness and local activist organizations can benefit from novel electronic potentials for global operation. I show how financial electronic networks and electronic activism reveal two parallel developments associated with particular technical properties of the new ICTs, but also reveal a third, radically divergent outcome, one I interpret as signaling the weight of the specific social logics of users in each case. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll113" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll113',113)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide115" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Since its early beginnings in the 1980s, much has been achieved in the research field of software architecture. Among other aspects, this research has produced foundational work on the specification, analysis and component configuration of software architectures, including the development of associated software tools. However, adoption of the research by industry has been largely methodological rather than based on precise specifications in architecture description languages (ADLs) or rigorously underpinned by formal models of behaviour and non-functional attributes. Why is this? Why were the actual formalisms and tools not more widely adopted? Can we draw any lessons from this? In this talk, I hope to explore this further, drawing on my personal experience as a researcher in distributed software architectures. </p> <p> I particularly hope to tickle the fancy of the younger members of our community, indicating the excitement of research, the benefits of belonging to a vibrant research community such as ours, and the benefits of being an active contributor. For the more mature researchers, there will be some nostalgic memories combined with some inevitable stepping on toes. For both young and old, there will be some thoughts for research opportunities as the need for self-managing adaptive software systems becomes more urgent. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll115" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll115',115)">expand</a>

Cloud infrastructures provide the means to lease computational resources on demand, typically on a pay per use or subscription model and without the need for significant capital investment into hardware. With enterprises seeking to migrate their services to the cloud to save on deployment costs, cater for rapid growth or generally relieve themselves from the responsibility of maintaining their own computing infrastructures, a diverse range of services is required to help fulfil business processes. In this talk, we discuss some of the challenges involved in deploying and managing an ecosystem of loosely coupled cloud services that may be accessed through and integrate with a wide range of devices and third party applications. In particular, we focus on how projects such as OpenStack are accelerating the evolution towards a federated cloud service ecosystem. We also examine how the portfolio of existing and emerging standards such as OAuth and the Simple Cloud Identity Management framework can be exploited to seamlessly incorporate cloud services into business processes and solve the problem of identity and access management when dealing with applications exploiting services across organisational boundaries. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll117" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll117',117)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide118" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Specification patterns have proven to help developers to state precise system requirements, as well as formalize them by means of dedicated specification languages. Most of the past work has focused its applicability area to the specification of concurrent and real-time systems, and has been limited to a research setting. In this paper we present the results of our study on specification patterns for service-based applications (SBAs). The study focuses on industrial SBAs in the banking domain. We started by performing an extensive analysis of the usage of specification patterns in published research case studies --- representing almost ten years of research in the area of specification, verification, and validation of SBAs. We then compared these patterns with a large body of specifications written by our industrial partner over a similar time period. The paper discusses the outcome of this comparison, indicating that some needs of the industry, especially in the area of requirements specification languages, are not fully met by current software engineering research. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll118" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll118',118)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide119" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Research about process instance migration covers mainly changes in process models during the process evolution and their effects on the same runtime environment. But what if the runtime environment - a legacy Business Process Execution (BPE) platform - had to be replaced with a new solution? Several migration aspects must be taken into account. (1) Process models from the old BPE platform have to be converted to the target process definition language on the target BPE platform. (2) Existing Business Process Management (BPM) applications must be integrated via new BPE platform interfaces. (3) Process instances and process instance data state must be migrated. For each of these points an appropriate migration strategy must be chosen. This paper describes the migration methodology which was applied for the BPE platform renewal in Credit Suisse. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll119" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll119',119)">expand</a>

Yet engineers often lack the tools and techniques necessary to leverage these potentially powerful information resources toward decision making. In this paper, we present the data and analysis needs of professional software engineers, which we identified among 110 developers and managers in a survey. We asked about their decision making process, their needs for artifacts and indicators, and scenarios in which they would use analytics. </p> <p> The survey responses lead us to propose several guidelines for analytics tools in software development including: Engineers do not necessarily have much expertise in data analysis; thus tools should be easy to use, fast, and produce concise output. Engineers have diverse analysis needs and consider most indicators to be important; thus tools should at the same time support many different types of artifacts and many indicators. In addition, engineers want to drill down into data based on time, organizational structure, and system architecture. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll120" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll120',120)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide126" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> To be competitive in today's market, the IT industry faces many challenges in the development and maintenance of enterprise information systems. Engineering these largescaled systems efficiently requires making decisions about a number of issues. In addition, customer&#226;s expectations imply continuous software delivery in predictable quality. The operation such systems demands for transparency of the software in regard to lifecycle, change and incident management as well as cost efficiency. Addressing these challenges, we learned how to benefit from traditional industries. Contrary to the fact that the IT business calls itself gladly an industry, the industrialization of software engineering in most cases moves on a rather modest level. Industrialization means not only to build a solution or product on top of managed and well-defined processes, but also to have access to structured information about the current conditions of manufacturing at any time. Comparably with test series and assembly lines of the automobile industry, each individual component and each step from the beginning of manufacturing up to the final product should be equipped with measuring points for quality and progress. Even one step further the product itself, after it has left the factory, should be able to continuously provide analytic data for diagnostic reasons. Information is automatically collected and builds the basic essentials for process control, optimization and continuous improvement of the software engineering process. This presentation shows by means of a practical experience report how AdNovum managed to build its software engineering based on a well-balanced system of processes, continuous measurement and control - as well as a healthy portion of pragmatism. We implemented an efficient and predictable software delivery pipeline based on five cornerstones that enables us to ship more than 1500 customer deliveries per year. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll126" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll126',126)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide128" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Automated code analysis is technology aimed at locating, describing and repairing areas of weakness in code. Code weaknesses range from security vulnerabilities, logic errors, concurrency violations, to improper resource usage, violations of architectures or coding guidelines. Common to all code analysis techniques is that they build abstractions of code and then check those abstractions for properties of interest. For instance a type checker computes how types are used, abstract interpreters and symbolic evaluators check how values flow, model checkers analyze how state evolves. Building modern program analysis tools thus requires a multi-pronged approach to find a variety of weaknesses. In this talk I will discuss and compare several program analysis tools, which MSR build during the last ten years. They include theorem provers, program verifiers, bug finders, malware scanners, and test case generators. I will describe the need for their development, their innovation, and application. Many of these tools had considerable impact on Microsoft's development practices, as well as on the research community. Some of them are being shipped in products such as the Static Driver Verifier or as part of Visual Studio. Performing program analysis as part of quality assurance is meanwhile standard practice in many software development companies. However several challenges have not yet been resolved. Thus, I will conclude with a set of open challenges in program analysis which hopefully triggers new aspiring directions in our joint quest of delivering predictable software that is free from defect and vulnerabilities. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll128" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll128',128)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide130" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> This paper describes a novel framework for creating a parser to process and analyze texts written in a ``partially structured'' natural language. In many projects, the contents of document artifacts tend to be described as a mixture of formal parts (i.e. the text constructs follow specific conventions) and parts written in arbitrary free text. Formal parsers, typically defined and used to process a description with rigidly defined syntax such as program source code are very precise and efficient in processing the formal part, while parsers developed for natural language processing (NLP) are good at robustly interpreting the free-text part. Therefore, combining these parsers with different characteristics can allow for more flexible and practical processing of various project documents. Unfortunately, conventional approaches to constructing a parser from multiple small parsers were studied extensively only for formal language parsers and are not directly applicable to NLP parsers due to the differences in the way the input text is extracted and evaluated. We propose a method to configure and generate a combined parser by extending an approach based on parser combinator, the operators for composing multiple formal parsers, to support both NLP and formal parsers. The resulting text parser is based on Parsing Expression Grammars, and it benefits from the strength of both parser types. We demonstrate an application of such combined parser in practical situations and show that the proposed approach can efficiently construct a parser for analyzing project-specific industrial specification documents. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll130" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll130',130)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide131" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> This paper reports on the usage of a broad palette of formal modeling and analysis techniques on a regular industrial-size design of an ultra-modern satellite platform. These efforts were carried out in parallel with the conventional software development of the satellite platform. The model itself is expressed in a formalized dialect of AADL. Its formal nature enables rigorous and automated analysis, for which the recently developed COMPASS toolset was used. The whole effort revealed numerous inconsistencies in the early design documents, and the use of formal analyses provided additional insight on discrete system behavior (comprising nearly 50 million states), on hybrid system behavior involving discrete and continuous variables, and enabled the automated generation of large fault trees (66 nodes) for safety analysis that typically are constructed by hand. The model's size pushed the computational tractability of the algorithms underlying the formal analyses, and revealed bottlenecks for future theoretical research. Additionally, the effort led to newly learned practices from which subsequent formal modeling and analysis efforts shall benefit, especially when they are injected in the conventional software development lifecycle. The case demonstrates the feasibility of fully capturing a system-level design as a single comprehensive formal model and analyze it automatically using a toolset based on (probabilistic) model checkers. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll131" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll131',131)">expand</a>

It details which treatments and procedures are covered by the health insurer (or payer), and at which conditions. While the most accurate and complete implementation of the plan resides in the payer&#226;s claims adjudication systems, the inherent complexity of these systems forces payers to maintain multiple repositories of benefit information for other service and regulatory needs. In this paper we present a technology that deals with this complexity. We show how a large US health payer benefited from using the visualization, search, summarization and other capabilities of the technology. We argue that this technology can be used to improve productivity and reduce error rate in the benefits administration workflow, leading to lower administrative overhead and cost for health payers, which benefits both payers and patients. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll135" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll135',135)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide136" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Program comprehension is a key activity through maintenance and evolution of large-scale software systems. The understanding of a program often requires the evolution analysis of individual functionalities, so-called features. The comprehension of evolving features is not trivial as their implementations are often tangled and scattered through many modules. Even worse, existing techniques are limited in providing developers with direct means for visualizing the evolution of features&#226; code. This work presents a proactive and interactive visualization strategy to enable feature evolution analysis. It proactively identifies code elements of evolving features and provides multiple views to present their structure under different perspectives. The novel visualization strategy was compared to a lightweight visualization strategy based on a tree-structure. We ran a controlled experiment with industry developers, who performed feature evolution comprehension tasks on an industrial-strength software. The results showed that the use of the proposed strategy presented significant gains in terms of correctness and execution time for feature evolution comprehension tasks. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll136" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll136',136)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide137" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Commercial static program analysis tools can be used to detect many defects that are common across applications. However, such tools currently have limited ability to reveal defects that are specific to individual projects, unless specialized checkers are devised and implemented by tool users. Developers do not typically exploit this capability. By contrast, defect mining tools developed by researchers can discover project-specific defects, but they require specialized expertise to employ and they may not be robust enough for general use. We present a hybrid approach in which a sophisticated dependence-based rule mining tool is used to discover project-specific programming rules, which are then transformed automatically into checkers that a commercial static analysis tool can run against a code base to reveal defects. We also present the results of an empirical study in which this approach was applied successfully to two large industrial code bases. Finally, we analyze the potential implications of this approach for software development practice. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll137" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll137',137)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide139" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> At ICSE 2010, the Code Bubbles team from Brown University and the Code Canvas team from Microsoft Research presented similar ideas for new user experiences for an integrated development environment. Since then, the two teams formed a collaboration, along with the Microsoft Visual Studio team, to release Debugger Canvas, an industrial version of the Code Bubbles paradigm. With Debugger Canvas, a programmer debugs her code as a collection of code bubbles, annotated with call paths and variable values, on a two-dimensional pan-and-zoom surface. In this experience report, we describe new user interface ideas, describe the rationale behind our design choices, evaluate the performance overhead of the new design, and provide user feedback based on lab participants, post-release usage data, and a user survey and interviews. We conclude that the code bubbles paradigm does scale to existing customer code bases, is best implemented as a mode in the existing user experience rather than a replacement, and is most useful when the user has a long or complex call paths, a large or unfamiliar code base, or complex control patterns, like factories or dynamic linking. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll139" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll139',139)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide140" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Fixing bugs is an important part of the software development process. An underlying aspect is the effectiveness of fixes: if a fair number of fixed bugs are reopened, it could indicate instability in the software system. To the best of our knowledge there has been on little prior work on understanding the dynamics of bug reopens. Towards that end, in this paper, we characterize when bug reports are reopened by using the Microsoft Windows operating system project as an empirical case study. Our analysis is based on a mixed-methods approach. First, we categorize the primary reasons for reopens based on a survey of 358 Microsoft employees. We then reinforce these results with a large-scale quantitative study of Windows bug reports, focusing on factors related to bug report edits and relationships between people involved in handling the bug. Finally, we build statistical models to describe the impact of various metrics on reopening bugs ranging from the reputation of the opener to how the bug was found. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll140" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll140',140)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide141" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Software often crashes. Once a crash happens, a crash report could be sent to software developers for investigation upon user permission. To facilitate efficient handling of crashes, crash reports received by Microsoft's Windows Error Reporting (WER) system are organized into a set of "buckets". Each bucket contains duplicate crash reports that are deemed as manifestations of the same bug. The bucket information is important for prioritizing efforts to resolve crashing bugs. To improve the accuracy of bucketing, we propose ReBucket, a method for clustering crash reports based on call stack matching. ReBucket measures the similarities of call stacks in crash reports and then assigns the reports to appropriate buckets based on the similarity values. We evaluate ReBucket using crash data collected from five widely-used Microsoft products. The results show that ReBucket achieves better overall performance than the existing methods. In average, the F-measure obtained by ReBucket is about 0.88. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll141" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll141',141)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide143" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Pair Programming is one of the most studied and debated development techniques. However, at present, we do not have a clear, objective, and quantitative understanding of the claimed benefits of such development approach. All the available studies focus on the analysis of the effects of Pair Programming (e.g., code quality, development speed, etc.) with different findings and limited replicability of the experiments. This paper adopts a different approach that could be replicated in an easier way: it investigates how Pair Programming affects the way developers write code and interact with their development machine. In particular, the paper focuses on the effects that Pair Programming has on developers&#8217; attention and productivity. The study was performed on a professional development team observed for ten months and it finds out that Pair Programming helps developers to eliminate distracting activities and to focus on productive activities. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll143" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll143',143)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide147" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p>Software development at Google is big and fast. The code base receives 20+ code changes per minute and 50% of the files change every month! Each product is developed and released from head relying on automated tests verifying the product behavior. Release frequency varies from multiple times per day to once every few weeks, depending on the product team. With such a huge, fast-moving codebase, it is possible for teams to get stuck spending a lot of time just keeping their build green. A continuous integration system should help by providing the exact change at which a test started failing, instead of a range of suspect changes or doing a lengthy binary-search for the offending change. We have built a system that uses dependency analysis to determine all the tests a change transitively affects and then runs only those tests for every change. The system is built on top of Google's cloud computing infrastructure enabling many builds to be executed concurrently, allowing the system to run affected tests as soon as a change is submitted. The use of smart tools and cloud computing infrastructure in the continuous integration system enables quick, effective feedback to development teams.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll147" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll147',147)">expand</a>

This paper presents a practical approach that emerged from a concrete industrial case in the smart card domain at STMicroelectronics Belgium in order to better address this kind of challenge. The central concept is a test knowledge repository organized as a collection of specific patterns named QPatterns. A systematic process was followed, first to gather, structure and abstract the test practices, then to produce and validate an initial repository, and finally to make it evolve later on Testers can then rely on this repository to produce high quality test plans identifying all the functional and non-functional aspects that have to be addressed, as well as the concrete tests that have to be developed within the context of a new project. A tool support was also developed and integrated in a traceable way into the existing industrial test environment. The approach was validated and is currently under deployment at STMicroelectronics Belgium. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll148" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll148',148)">expand</a>

There are no models that seamlessly integrate both aspects. In the project Quamoco, we built a comprehensive approach with the aim to close this gap. </p> <p> For this, we developed in several iterations a meta quality model specifying general concepts, a quality base model covering the most important quality factors and a quality assessment approach. The meta model introduces the new concept of a product factor, which bridges the gap between concrete measurements and abstract quality aspects. Product factors have measures and instruments to operationalise quality by measurements from manual inspection and tool analysis. The base model uses the ISO 25010 quality attributes, which we refine by 200 factors and 600 measures for Java and C# systems. </p> <p> We found in several empirical validations that the assessment results fit to the expectations of experts for the corresponding systems. The empirical analyses also showed that several of the correlations are statistically significant and that the maintainability part of the base model has the highest correlation, which fits to the fact that this part is the most comprehensive. Although we still see room for extending and improving the base model, it shows a high correspondence with expert opinions and hence is able to form the basis for repeatable and understandable quality assessments in practice. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll149" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll149',149)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide150" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> As smartphones become popular, manufacturers such as Samsung Electronics are developing smartphones with rich functionality such as a camera and photo editing quickly, which accelerates the adoption of open source applications in the smartphone platforms. However, developers often do not know the detail of open source applications, because they did not develop the applications themselves. Thus, it is a challenging problem to test open source applications effectively in short time. This paper reports our experience of applying concolic testing technique to test libexif, an open source library to manipulate EXIF information in image files. We have demonstrated that concolic testing technique is effective and efficient at detecting bugs with modest effort in industrial setting. We also compare two concolic testing tools, CREST-BV and KLEE, in this testing project. Furthermore, we compare the concolic testing results with the analysis result of the Coverity Prevent static analyzer. We detected a memory access bug, a null pointer dereference bug, and four divide-by-zero bugs in libexif through concolic testing, none of which were detected by Coverity Prevent. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll150" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll150',150)">expand</a>

Software development has also become to contain more social aspects and the need for collaboration has become more evident. The importance of teaching development methods used in collaborative development is of importance, as skills beyond traditional software development are needed in this modern setting. A novel, student centric approach was tried out at Tampere University of Technology where a new environment called KommGame was introduced. This environment includes a reputation system to support the social aspect of the environment and thus supporting the learner&#8217;s collaboration with each other. In this paper, we present the KommGame environment and how it was applied on a course for practical results. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll153" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll153',153)">expand</a>

We describe the first iteration of a course that enabled 73 students to work together to improve a large common legacy code base using professional practices and tools, staffed only by two lecturers and two undergraduate students employed as part-time tutors. The course relies on continuous integration and automated metrics, that coalesce frequently updated information in a manner that is visible to students and can be monitored by a small number of staff. The course is supported by a just-in-time teaching programme of thirty-two technical topics. We describe the constraints that determined the design of the course, and quantitative and qualitative data from the first iteration of the course. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll154" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll154',154)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide156" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> This paper describes how a staged approach to the development of students&#8217; abilities to engineer software systems applies to the specific issue of teaching software testing. It evaluates the courses relating to software testing in the Software Engineering volume of Computing Curriculum 2001 against a theoretical model that has been developed from a well-established programme in software engineering, from the perspectives of how well the courses support the progressive development of both students&#8217; knowledge of software testing and their ability to test software systems. It is shown that this progressive development is not well supported, and that to improve this some software testing material should be taught earlier than recommended. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll156" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll156',156)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide158" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Context: In teaching about software engineering we currently make little use of any empirical knowledge. Aim: To examine the outcomes available from the use of Evidence-Based Software Engineering (EBSE) practices, so as to identify where these can provide support for, and inform, teaching activities. Method: We have examined all known secondary studies published up to the end of 2009, together with those published in major journals to mid-2011, and identified where these provide practical results that are relevant to student needs. Results: Starting with 145 candidate systematic literature reviews (SLRs), we were able to identify and classify potentially useful teaching material from 43 of them. Conclusions: EBSE can potentially lend authority to our teaching, although the coverage of key topics is uneven. Additionally, mapping studies can provide support for research-led teaching. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll158" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll158',158)">expand</a>

These applications are typically critical in nature and require software practitioners who have considerable competency in the area of software engineering. To enhance the competency of engineers, CT DC IN has introduced an internal curriculum titled "FOundation CUrriculum for Software engineers" (FOCUS) which is an adapted version of IEEE's SWEBOK curriculum. The FOCUS program has been used to train more than 500 engineers in the last three years. In this experience report, we describe the motivation for FOCUS, how it was structured to address the specific needs of CT DC IN, and how the FOCUS program was rolled out within the organization. We also provide results obtained from a survey of the FOCUS participants, their managers, and FOCUS trainers that was conducted to throw light on the effectiveness of the program. We believe the insights from the survey results provide useful pointers to other organizations and academic institutions that are planning to adopt a SWEBOK-based curriculum. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll160" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll160',160)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide164" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Handling large-sized classes and maintaining students&#8217; involvement are two of the major challenges in Personal Software Process (PSP) education in universities. In order to tackle these two challenges, we adapted and incorporated some typical practices of Pair Programming (PP) into the PSP class at summer school in Software Institute of Nanjing University in 2010, and received positive results, such as higher students&#8217; involvement, and conformity of process discipline, as well as (half) workload reduction in evaluating assignments. However, the experiment did not confirm the improved performance of the paired students as expected. Based on the experience and feedbacks, we improved this approach in our PSP course in 2011. Accordingly, by analyzing the previous experiment results, we redesigned the experiment with a number of improvements, such as lab environment, evaluation methods and student selection, to further investigate the effects of this approach in PSP education, in particular students&#8217; performance. We also introduced several new metrics to enable the comparison analysis of the data collected from both paired students and solo students. The new experiment confirms the value of pairing practices in PSP education. The results show that in PSP class, compared to solo students, paired students can achieve better performance in terms of program quality and exam scores. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll164" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll164',164)">expand</a>

We present an approach to detect the current activity of software developers and if they are facing a problem. By observing developer actions like changing code or searching the web, we detect whether developers are locating the cause of a problem, searching for a solution, or applying a solution. We model development work as recurring problem solution cycle, detect developer&#226;s actions by instrumenting the IDE, translate developer actions to observations using ontologies, and infer developer activities by using Hidden Markov Models. In a preliminary evaluation, our approach was able to correctly detect 72% of all activities.

This research investigates software process improvement (SPI) through the application of knowledge management (KM) at the software project level. A pilot study was conducted to investigate what types of obstacles to knowledge flow exist within a software development project, as well as the potential influence on SPI of their mitigation or removal. The KM technique of &#8220;knowledge mapping&#8221; was used as a research technique to characterize knowledge flow. Results show that such mitigation or removal was acknowledged by project team members as having the potential for lowering project labor cost, improving schedule adherence, and enhancing final product quality. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll168" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll168',168)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide169" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Domain-Specific Modeling Languages (DSMLs) have received great attention in recent years and are expected to play a big role in the future of software engineering as processes become more view-centric. However, they are a "two-edged sword". While they provide strong support for communication within communities, allowing experts to express themselves using concepts tailored to their exact needs, they are a poor vehicle for communication across communities because of their lack of common, transcending concepts. In contrast, General-Purpose Modeling Languages (GPMLs) have the opposite problem - they are poor at the former but good at the latter. The value of models in software engineering would therefore be significantly boosted if the advantages of DSMLs and GPMLs could be combined and models could be viewed in a domain-specific or general-purpose way depending on the needs of the user. In this paper we present an approach for achieving such a synergy based on the orthogonal classification architecture. In this architecture model elements have two classifiers: a linguistic one representing their "general-purpose" and an ontological one representing their "domain-specific" type. By associating visualization symbols with both classifiers it is possible to support two concrete syntaxes at the same time and allow the domain-specific and general-purpose notation to support each other - that is, to form a symbiotic relationship. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll169" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll169',169)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide170" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Text retrieval approaches have been used to address many software engineering tasks. In most cases, their use involves issuing a textual query to retrieve a set of relevant software artifacts from the system. The performance of all these approaches depends on the quality of the given query (i.e., its ability to describe the information need in such a way that the relevant software artifacts are retrieved during the search). Currently, the only way to tell that a query failed to lead to the expected software artifacts is by investing time and effort in analyzing the search results. In addition, it is often very difficult to ascertain what part of the query leads to poor results. We propose a novel pre-retrieval metric, which reflects the quality of a query by measuring the specificity of its terms. We exemplify the use of the new specificity metric on the task of concept location in source code. A preliminary empirical study shows that our metric is a good effort predictor for text retrieval-based concept location, outperforming existing techniques from the field of natural language document retrieval. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll170" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll170',170)">expand</a>

The augmentation of software software engineers&#8217; intellectual capabilities is proposed as a third complement to the traditional focus of methodologies on the process and environmental factors of the software development endeavor. I argue that these capabilities have been shown to be open to improvement through the practices traditionally used in spiritual traditions, but now used increasingly in other fields of knowledge work, such as in the medical profession and the education field. Historically, the intellectual capabilities of software engineers have been treated as a given within any particular software development effort. This is argued to be an aspect ripe for inclusion within software development methodologies. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll173" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll173',173)">expand</a>

For commercial software vendors, the time to repair defects in deployed business-critical software products or applications is a key quality metric for sustained customer satisfaction. In this paper, we report on the analysis of about 1,500 defect records from an IBM middle-ware product collected over a five-year period. The analysis includes a characterization of each repaired defect by topic and a ranking of developers by inferred expertise on each topic. We find clear evidence that defect resolution time is strongly influenced by the specific developer and his/her expertise in the defect's topic. To validate our approach, we conducted interviews with the product&#226;s manager who provided us with his own ranking of developer expertise for comparison. We argue that our automated developer expertise ranking can be beneficial in the planning of a software project and is applicable beyond software support in the other phases of the software lifecycle. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll177" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll177',177)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide178" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Power consumption is increasingly becoming a concern for not only electrical engineers, but for software engineers as well, due to the increasing popularity of new power-limited contexts such as mobile-computing, smart-phones and cloud-computing. Software changes can alter software power consumption behaviour and can cause power performance regressions. By tracking software power consumption we can build models to provide suggestions to avoid power regressions. There is much research on software power consumption, but little focus on the relationship between software changes and power consumption. Most work measures the power consumption of a single software task; instead we seek to extend this work across the history (revisions) of a project. We develop a set of tests for a well established product and then run those tests across all versions of the product while recording the power usage of these tests. We provide and demonstrate a methodology that enables the analysis of power consumption performance for over 500 nightly builds of Firefox 3.6; we show that software change does induce changes in power consumption. This methodology and case study are a first step towards combining power measurement and mining software repositories research, thus enabling developers to avoid power regressions via power consumption awareness. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll178" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll178',178)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide179" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Software behavior learning is an important task in software engineering. Software behavior is usually represented as a program execution. It is expected that similar executions have similar behavior, i.e. revealing the same faults. Single-label learning has been used to assign a single label (fault) to a failing execution in the existing efforts. However, a failing execution may be caused by several faults simultaneously. Hence, it needs to assign multiple labels to support software engineering tasks in practice. In this paper, we present multi-label software behavior learning. A well-known multi-label learning algorithm ML-KNN is introduced to achieve comprehensive learning of software behavior. We conducted a preliminary experiment on two industrial programs: flex and grep. The experimental results show that multi-label learning can produce more precise and complete results than single-label learning. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll179" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll179',179)">expand</a>

The inherent graph-like structure of object-oriented systems calls for the application of the corresponding methods and tools to analyze software evolution. In this paper we investigate network properties of two open-source systems and observe interesting phenomena regarding their growth. Relating the observed evolutionary trends to principles and laws of software design enables a high-level assessment of tendencies in the underlying design quality. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll180" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll180',180)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide184" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Online social networks are now common place in day-to-day lives. They are also increasingly used to drive social action initiatives, either led by government or communities themselves (e.g., SeeClickFix, LoveLewisham.org, mumsnet). However, such initiatives are mainly used for crowd sourcing community views or coordinating activities. With the changing global economic and political landscape, there is an ever pressing need to engage citizens on a large-scale, not only in consultations about systems that affect them, but also involve them directly in the design of these very systems. In this paper we present the UDesignIt platform that combines social media technologies with software engineering concepts to empower communities to discuss and extract high-level design features. It combines natural language processing, feature modelling and visual overlays in the form of ``image clouds'' to enable communities and software engineers alike to unlock the knowledge contained in the unstructured and unfiltered content of social media where people discuss social problems and their solutions. By automatically extracting key themes and presenting them in a structured and organised manner in near real-time, the approach drives a shift towards large-scale engagement of community stakeholders for system design. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll184" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll184',184)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide186" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Software Engineering challenges and contests are becoming increasingly popular for focusing researchers' efforts on particular problems. Such contests tend to follow either an exploratory model, in which the contest holders provide data and ask the contestants to discover ``interesting things'' they can do with it, or task-oriented contests in which contestants must perform a specific task on a provided dataset. Only occasionally do contests provide more rigorous evaluation mechanisms that precisely specify the task to be performed and the metrics that will be used to evaluate the results. In this paper, we propose actionable and crowd-sourced contests: actionable because the contest describes a precise task, datasets, and evaluation metrics, and also provides a downloadable operating environment for the contest; and crowd-sourced because providing these features creates accessibility to Information Technology hobbyists and students who are attracted by the challenge. Our proposed approach is illustrated using research challenges from the software traceability area as well as an experimental workbench named TraceLab. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll186" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll186',186)">expand</a>

In past user studies we have observed that when being presented with collaboration views and word clouds from the system's history engineers start sharing memories linked to those visualizations. In this paper we propose an approach based on a story-telling visualization, which is designed to entice engineers to share and document their tribal memory. Sticky notes can be used to share memories of a system's lifetime events, such as past design rationales but also more casual memories like pictures from after-work beer or a hackathon. We present an early-stage prototype implementation and include two design studies created using that prototype. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll187" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll187',187)">expand</a>

However, it is challenging to guarantee the correctness of their behaviors due to the complex nature of the autonomous agents, especially when they have stochastic characteristics. In this work, we propose to apply probabilistic model checking to analyze multi-agent systems. A modeling language called PMA is defined to specify such kind of systems, and LTL property and logic of knowledge combined with probabilistic requirements are supported to analyze system behaviors. Initial evaluation indicates the effectiveness of our current progress; meanwhile some challenges and possible solutions are discussed as our ongoing work. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll189" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll189',189)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide190" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Developing cyber-physical systems (CPS) is challenging because correctness depends on both logical and physical states, which are collectively difficult to observe. The developer often need to repeatedly rerun the system while observing its behavior and tweak the hardware and software until it meets minimum requirements. This process is tedious, error-prone, and lacks rigor. To address this, we propose BRACE, a framework that simplifies the process by enabling developers to correlate cyber (i.e., logical) and physical properties of the system via assertions. This paper presents our initial investigation into the requirements and semantics of such assertions, which we call CPS assertions. We discusses our experience implementing and using the framework with a mobile robot, and highlight key future research challenges. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll190" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll190',190)">expand</a>

We demonstrate the potential benefits of our technique by presenting four concrete scenarios in which the Eclipse IDE fails to provide proper Quick Fixes at relevant locations, even though it offers those fixes at other locations. We describe a technique that can augment an existing IDE&#8217;s recommendations to account for non-local information. For example, when some compilation errors depend on others, our technique helps the developer decide which errors to resolve first. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll192" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll192',192)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide193" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Modern software systems need to be continuously available under varying conditions. Their ability to dynamically adapt to their execution context is thus increasingly seen as a key to their success. Recently, many approaches were proposed to design and support the execution of Dynamically Adaptive Systems (DAS). However, the ability of a DAS to evolve is limited to the addition, update or removal of adaptation rules or reconfiguration scripts. These artifacts are very specific to the control loop managing such a DAS and runtime evolution of the DAS requirements may affect other parts of the DAS. In this paper, we argue to evolve all parts of the loop. We suggest leveraging recent advances in model-driven techniques to offer an approach that supports the evolution of both systems and their adaptation capabilities. The basic idea is to consider the control loop itself as an adaptive system. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll193" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll193',193)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide195" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> We propose an extension of van Lamsweerde&#8217;s goal-oriented requirements engineering to the domain of programmable DNA nanotechnology. This is a domain in which individual devices (agents) are at most a few dozen nanometers in diameter. These devices are programmed to assemble themselves from molecular components and perform their assigned tasks. The devices carry out their tasks in the probabilistic world of chemical kinetics, so they are individually error-prone. However, the number of devices deployed is roughly on the order of a nanomole, and some goals are achieved when enough of these agents achieve their assigned subgoals. We show that it is useful in this setting to augment the AND/OR goal diagrams to allow goal refinements that are mediated by threshold functions, rather than ANDs or ORs. We illustrate this method by engineering requirements for a system of molecular detectors (DNA origami &#8220;pliers&#8221; that capture target molecules) invented by Kuzuya, Sakai, Yamazaki, Xu, and Komiyama (2011). We model this system in the Prism probabilistic symbolic model checker, and we use Prism to verify that requirements are satisfied. This gives prima facie evidence that software engineering methods can be used to make DNA nanotechnology more productive, predictable and safe. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll195" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll195',195)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide198" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Combinatorial test design (CTD) is an effective test planning technique that reveals faulty feature interactions in a given system. The test space is modeled by a set of parameters, their respective values, and restrictions on the value combinations. A subset of the test space is then automatically constructed so that it covers all valid value combinations of every $t$ parameters, where $t$ is a user input. </p> <p> When applying CTD to real-life testing problems, it can often occur that the result of CTD cannot be used as is, and manual modifications to the tests are performed. One example is very limited resources that significantly reduce the number of tests that can be used. Another example is complex restrictions that are not captured in the model of the test space. The main concern is that manually modifying the result of CTD might potentially introduce coverage gaps that the user is unaware of. In this paper we present a tool that supports interactive modification of a combinatorial test plan, both manually and with tool assistance. For each modification, the tool displays the new coverage gaps that will be introduced, and enables the user to take educated decisions on what to include in the final set of tests. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll198" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll198',198)">expand</a>

To this end, it provides an experimental environment in which researchers can design and execute experiments in TraceLab's visual modeling environment using a library of reusable and user-defined components. TraceLab fosters research competitions by allowing researchers or industrial sponsors to launch research contests intended to focus attention on compelling traceability challenges. Contests are centered around specific traceability tasks, performed on publicly available datasets, and are evaluated using standard metrics incorporated into reusable TraceLab components. TraceLab has been released in beta-test mode to researchers at seven universities, and will be publicly released via CoEST.org in the summer of 2012. Furthermore, by late 2012 TraceLab's source code will be released as open source software, licensed under GPL. TraceLab currently runs on Windows but is designed with cross platforming issues in mind to allow easy ports to Unix and Mac environments. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll199" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll199',199)">expand</a>

In this paper we present MASH, a tool that eases the programming of Integrated Development Environments. The tool supports the definition of workflows that can be quickly designed to integrate functionalities offered by multiple plug-ins, without the need of knowing anything about the internal architecture of the IDE. Workflows can be easily reshaped every time an analysis must be modified, without the need of producing Java code and deploying components in the IDE. Early results suggest that this approach can effectively facilitate programming of IDEs. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll202" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll202',202)">expand</a>

Client-side program entities such as HTML presentation elements and Javascript functions/variables are embedded within server-side string literals or variables' values. However, existing tools for code maintenance such as automatic renaming support only work for program entities in a single language on either the server side or the client side.

We introduce GraPacc, an advanced, context-sensitive code completion tool that is based on frequent API usage patterns. It extracts the context-sensitive features from the code under editing, e.g. the API elements on focus and the current editing point, and their relations to other code elements.

However, focusing only on source code can lead to unrealistic or irrelevant test cases, while only exploring a user interface often misses much of the underlying program behavior. Our EXSYST prototype takes a new approach by exploring user interfaces while aiming to maximize code coverage, thus combining the best of both worlds. Experiments show that such an approach can achieve high code coverage matching and exceeding the code coverage of traditional unit-based test generators; yet, by construction every test case is realistic and relevant, and every detected failure can be shown to be caused by a real sequence of input events. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll212" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll212',212)">expand</a>

Of particular importance are parametric monitoring systems, which allow the specification of properties that relate objects in a program, rather than only global properties. In the past decade, a number of parametric runtime monitoring systems have been developed. Here we give a demonstration of our system, JavaMOP. It is the only parametric monitoring system that allows multiple differing logical formalisms. It is also the most efficient in terms of runtime overhead, and very competitive with respect to memory usage. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll213" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll213',213)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide216" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> The Mining Software Repositories (MSR) field integrates and analyzes data stored in repositories such as source control and bug repositories to support practitioners. Given the abundance of repository data, scaling up MSR analyses has become a major challenge. Recently, researchers have experimented with conventional techniques like a super-computer or cloud computing, but these are either too expensive or too hard to configure. This paper proposes to scale up MSR analysis using ``general-purpose computing on graphics processing units'' (GPGPU) on off-the-shelf video cards. In a representative MSR case study to measure co-change on version history of the Eclipse project, we find that the GPU approach is up to a factor of 43.9 faster than a CPU-only approach. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll216" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll216',216)">expand</a>

These can be scaled at runtime to dynamically adjust their resources allocation to maintain consistent quality of service in response to changing working conditions, like flash crowds or periodic peaks. Providers need models to predict the system performances of different resource allocations to fully exploit dynamic application scaling. Traditional performance models such as linear models and queuing networks might be simplistic for real Cloud applications; moreover, they are not robust to change. We propose a performance modelling approach that is practical for highly variable elastic applications in the Cloud and automatically adapts to changing working conditions. We show the effectiveness of the proposed approach for the synthesis of a self-adaptive controller. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll218" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll218',218)">expand</a>

We are also interested in understanding what is the trend of SOA (positive or negative?) and what are the methods, technologies and tools really used in the industry. The main findings of this survey are the following: (1) SOA is a relevant phenomenon in Italy, (2) Web services and RESTFul services are well-known/used and (3) orchestration languages and UDDI are little known and used. These results suggest that in Italy SOA is interpreted in a more simplistic way with respect to the current/real definition (i.e., without the concepts of orchestration/choreography and registry). Currently, the adoption of SOA is medium/low with a stable/positive trend of pervasiveness. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll219" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll219',219)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide227" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Programmers are spending a large and increasing amount of their time writing and modifying metadata, such as Java annotations and XML deployment descriptors. And yet, automatic bug finding tools cannot find metadata-related bugs introduced during program refactoring and enhancement. To address this shortcoming, we have created metadata invariants, a new programming abstraction that expresses naming and typing relationships between metadata and the main source code of a program. A paper that appears in the main technical program of ICSE 2012 describes the idea, concept, and prototype of metadata invariants. The goal of this demo is to supplement that paper with a demonstration of our Eclipse plugin, Metadata Bug Finder (MBF). MBF takes as input a script written in our domain-specific language that describes a set of metadata coding conventions the programmer wishes to enforce. Then after each file save operation, MBF checks the edited codebase for the presence of any violations of the given metadata programming conventions. These violations are immediately reported to the programmer as potential metadata-related bugs. By making the programmer aware of these potential bugs, MBF prevents them from seeping into production, thereby improving the overall correctness of the edited codebase. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll227" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll227',227)">expand</a>

Due to the very dynamic character of such systems as well as fast evolving technologies, most requirements cannot be planned a priori. To overcome this problem, we suggest a method to gather end-user needs for requirements engineers at any time by applying a geographical deployed feedback system. End-user needs are gathered in-situ by utilizing mobile devices. In this paper, we present the implementation of our feedback system enabling end-users to submit feedback with smartphones at very low effort and cost. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll229" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll229',229)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide232" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> To understand and improve processes in organizations, six key questions need to be answered, namely, what, how, where, who, when, why. Organizations with established processes have IT system(s) that gather(s) information about some or all of the key questions. Software organizations usually have defined processes, but they usually lack information about how processes are actually executed. Moreover, there is no explicit information about process instances and activities. Existing process mining techniques face problems in coping with such environment. We propose a tool, Egidio, which uses non-invasively collected data and builds organizational models. In particular, we explain the tool within a software company, which is able to extract different aspects of development processes. The main contribution of Egidio is the ability to mine processes and organizational models from fine-grained data collected in a non-invasive manner, without interrupting the developers&#8217; work. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll232" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll232',232)">expand</a>

A context model of the developer is used to improve search and give recommendations of these artifacts, which are ranked according to their relevance to the developer.

These changes push away the source code from its original design, often reducing its quality. In such cases refactoring techniques can be applied to improve the design quality of the system. Approaches existing in literature mainly exploit structural relationships present in the source code, e.g., method calls, to support the software engineer in identifying refactoring solutions. However, also semantic information is embedded in the source code by the developers, e.g., the terms used in the comments. This research investigates about the usefulness of combining structural and semantic information to support software refactoring. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll238" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll238',238)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide239" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Service-Oriented product lines (SOPLs) are dynamic software product lines, in which, the products are developed based on services and service-oriented architecture. Although there are similarities between components and services, there are important differences so that we cannot use component-based product line engineering methods and techniques for SOPL engineering. These differences emerge from the fact that, services can be discovered as black box elements from external repositories. Moreover, services can be dynamically bound and are business-aligned. Therefore, analyzing the conformance of discovered external services with the variability of services in the SOPL &#8211;which must be aligned to the variable business needs-is necessary. Variability must be managed, that is, it must be represented (modeled), used (instantiated and capable of conformance checking) and maintained (evolved) over time. Feature Models are insufficient for modeling variability in SOPL, because, services cannot be simply mapped to one or more features, and identification of the mapping depends on knowing the detailed implementation of the services. This research aims at providing an approach to managing the variability in SOPLs so that external services can be involved in the SOPL engineering. This paper presents an overview of the proposal. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll239" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll239',239)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide240" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Textual specification documents do not represent a suitable starting point for software development. This issue is due to the inherent problems of natural language such as ambiguity, impreciseness and incompleteness. In order to overcome these shortcomings, experts derive analysis models such as requirements models. However, these models are difficult and costly to create manually. Furthermore, the level of abstraction of the models is too low, thus hindering the automated transformation process. We propose a novel approach which uses high abstraction requirements models in the form of Object System Models (OSMs) as targets for the transformation of natural language specifications in conjunction with appropriate text mining and machine learning techniques. OSMs allow the interpretation of the textual specification based on a small set of facts and provide structural and behavioral information. This approach will allow both (1) the enhancement of minimal specifications, and in the case of comprehensive specifications (2) the determination of the most suitable structure of reusable requirements. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll240" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll240',240)">expand</a>

To guarantee high quality of web applications in terms of security, we propose a structured approach, inspired by software testing. In this paper we present our research plan and ongoing work to use security testing to address problems of potentially attackable code. Static analysis is used to reveal candidate vulnerabilities as a set of execution conditions that could lead to an attack. We then resort to automatic test case generation to obtain those input values that make the application execution satisfy such conditions.

<span id="toHide242" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Authorization infrastructures are an integral part of any network where resources need to be protected. As organisations start to federate access to their resources, authorization infrastructures become increasingly difficult to manage, to a point where relying only on human resources becomes unfeasible. In our work, we propose a Self-Adaptive Authorization Framework (SAAF) that is capable of monitoring the usage of resources, and controlling access to resources through the manipulation of authorization assets (e.g., authorization policies, access rights and sessions), due to the identification of abnormal usage. As part of this work, we explore the use of models for facilitating the autonomic management of federated authorization infrastructures by 1) classifying access behaviour exhibited by users, 2) modelling authorization assets, including usage, for identifying abnormal behaviour, and 3) managing authorization through the adaptation and reflection of modelled authorization assets. SAAF will be evaluated by integrating it into an existing authorization infrastructure that would allow the simulation of abnormal usage scenarios. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll242" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll242',242)">expand</a>

However, obtaining a modular, extensible and reusable PLA is a people-intensive and non-trivial task, related to different and possible conflicting factors. Hence, the PLA design is a hard problem and to find the best architecture can be formulated as an optimization problem with many factors. Similar Software Engineering problems have been efficiently solved by search-based algorithms in the field known as Search-based Software Engineering. The existing approaches used to optimize software architecture are not suitable since they do not encompass specific characteristics of SPL. To easy the SPL development and to automate the PLA design this work introduces a multi-objective optimization approach to the PLA design. The approach is now being implemented by using evolutionary algorithms. Empirical studies will be performed to validate the neighborhood operators, SPL measures and search algorithms chosen. Finally, we intend to compare the results of the proposed approach with PLAs designed by human architects. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll245" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll245',245)">expand</a>

One of the most difficult and complex tasks in the debugging activity is software fault localization. A commonly-used method to fix software fault is computing suspiciousness of program elements according to failed test executions and passed test executions. However, this technique does not give full consideration to dependences between program elements, thus its capacity for efficient fault localization is limited. Our research intends to introduce program slicing technique and statistical method which extracts dependencies between program elements and refines execution history, then builds program slicing spectra to rank suspicious elements by a statistical metric. We expect that our method will contribute directly to the improvement of the effectiveness and the accuracy of software fault localization and reduce the software development and maintenance effort and cost. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll246" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll246',246)">expand</a>

Literature performs task allocation between distributed sites on limited criteria irrespective of the communication and coordination needs of the people. Conway&#8217;s law relates product architecture with the communication and coordination needs of the people. Product architecture consists of multiple views based on different perspectives. Task allocation needs information about different architectural views and their interrelationships. Task allocation is also dependent on other factors not depicted in product architecture such as temporal, knowledge and cultural dependencies between distributed sites mentioned as external factors in the research. A well-conceived task allocation strategy will reduce communication and coordination dependency between sites/teams resulting in reduced time delay and smooth distributed development. The research aims to develop and validate a task allocation strategy based on information of system architecture for distributed environment. The strategy would consider all important factors during task allocation resulting in reduced communication and coordination overhead and time delay. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll247" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll247',247)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide250" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> It has been known for more than 20 years. If the subdomains are not homogeneous, partition testing strategies, such as branch or statement testing, do neither perform significantly better than random input generation nor do they inspire confidence when a test suite succeeds. Yet, measuring the adequacy of test suites in terms of code coverage is still considered a common practice. The main target of our research is to develop strategies for the automatic evolution of a test suite that does inspire confidence. When the program is changed, test cases shall be augmented that witness changed output for the same input (test suite augmentation). If two test cases witness the same partition, one is to be discarded (test suite reduction). </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll250" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll250',250)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide251" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> The performance of a system directly influences business critical metrics like total cost of ownership (TCO) and user satisfaction. However, building responsive, resource efficient and scalable applications is a challenging task. Thus, software engineering approaches are required to support software architects and developers in meeting these challenges. In this PhD research abstract, we propose a novel performance evaluation process applied during the software development phase. The goal is to increase the performance awareness of developers by providing feedback with respect to performance properties that is integrated in the every day development process. The feedback is based on domain-specific prediction functions derived by a generic methodology that executes a series of systematic measurements. We apply and validate the approach in different development scenarios at SAP. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll251" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll251',251)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide252" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> UML is a general-purpose modeling language that offers a heterogeneous set of diagrams to describe the different views of a software system. While there seems to be a general consensus on the semantics of some individual diagrams, the composite semantics of the different views is still an open problem. During my PhD I am considering a significant and consistent set of UML diagrams, where timed-related properties can be modeled carefully, and I am ascribing them with a formal semantics based on metric temporal logic. The use of logic is aimed to help capture the composite semantics of the different views efficiently. The result is then used to feed a bounded model/satisfiability checker to allow users to verify these systems, even from the initial phases of the design. The final goal is to realize an advanced modeling framework where users can exploit both a well-known modeling notation and advanced verification capabilities seamlessly. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll252" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll252',252)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide255" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Work dependencies often exist between the developers of a software project. These dependencies frequently result in a need for coordination between the involved developers. However, developers are not always aware of these Coordination Requirements. Current methods which detect the need to coordinate rely on information which is available only after development work has been completed. This does not enable developers to act on their coordination needs. Furthermore, even if developers were aware of all Coordination Requirements, they likely would be overwhelmed by the large number and would not be able to effectively follow up directly with the developers involved in each dependent task. I will investigate a more timely method to determine Coordination Requirements in a software development team as they emerge and how to focus the developers&#8217; attention on the most crucial ones. Further, I hope to prove that direct inter-personal communication is not always necessary to fulfill these requirements and gain insight on how we can develop tools that encourage cheaper forms of coordination. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll255" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll255',255)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide256" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Despite protracted efforts by both researchers and practitioners, security vulnerabilities remain in modern software. Artificial diversity is an effective defense against many types of attack, and one form, address-space randomization, has been widely applied. Present artificial diversity implementations are either coarse-grained or require source code. Because of the widespread use of software of unknown provenance, e.g., libraries, where no source code is provided or available, building diversity into the source code is not always possible. I investigate an approach to stack layout transformation that operates on x86 binary programs, which would allow users to obfuscate vulnerabilities and increase their confidence in the software&#8217;s dependability. The proposed approach is speculative: the stack frame layout for a function is inferred from the binary and assessed by executing the transformed program. Upon assessment failure, the inferred layout is refined in hopes to better reflect the actual function layout. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll256" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll256',256)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide258" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Existing software engineering techniques for automatic synthesis of event-based controllers have various limitations. In the context of the world/machine approach such limitations can be seen as restrictions in the expressiveness of the controller goals and domain model specifications or in the relation between the controllable and monitorable actions. In this thesis we aim to provide techniques that overcome such limitations, e.g. supporting more expressive goal specifications, distinguishing controllable from monitorable actions or guaranteeing achievement of the desired goals, among others. Hence, improving the state of the art in the synthesis of event-based controllers. Moreover, we plan to provide efficient tools supporting the developed techniques and evaluate them by modelling known case studies from the software engineering literature. Ultimately, showing that by allowing more expressiveness of controller goals and domain model specifications, and explicitly distinguishing controllable and monitorable actions such case studies can be more accurately modelled and solutions guaranteeing satisfaction of the goals can be achieved. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll258" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll258',258)">expand</a>

This PhD research aims to develop methods and tools to dilute parallel programming complexity and enable non-expert programmer to fully benefit from a new generation of parallelism-driven programming platforms.

<span id="toHide262" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> The literature describes several approaches to identify the artefacts of programs that evolve together to reveal the (hidden) dependencies among these artefacts and to infer and describe their evolution trends. We propose the use of biological methods to group artefacts, to detect co-evolution among them, and to construct their phylogenic trees to express their evolution trends. First, we introduced the novel concepts of macro co-changes (MCCs), i.e., of artefacts that co-change within a large time interval and of dephase macro co-changes (DMCCs), i.e., macro co-changes that always happen with the same shifts in time. We developped an approach, Macocha, to identify these new patterns of artefacts co-evolution in large programs. Now, we are analysing the evolution of classes playing roles in design pattern and&#8211;or anti-patterns. In parallel to previous work, we are detecting what classes are in macro co-change or in dephase macro co-change with the design motifs. Results trend to show that classes plying roles in design motifs have specifics evolution trends. Finally, we are implementing an approach, Profilo, to achieve the analysis of the evolution of artefacts and versions of large object-oriented programs. Profilo create a phylogenic tree of different versions of program that describes versions evolution and the relation among versions and programs. We will also evaluate the usefulness of our tools using lab and field studies. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll262" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll262',262)">expand</a>

Unfortunately, some of that behavior and knowledge incur societal costs, particularly with regards to Privacy, which is viewed quite differently by different populations as well as regulated differently in different locales. But clever technical solutions to those challenges may impose additional societal costs, e.g., by consuming substantial resources at odds with Green Computing, another major area of societal concern. We propose a new crosscutting research area, Societal Computing, that focuses on the technical tradeoffs among computational models and application domains that raise significant societal issues. This dissertation, advised by Prof. Gail Kaiser, will focus on privacy concerns in the context of Societal Computing and will aim to address research topics such as design patterns and architectures for privacy tradeoffs, better understanding of users' privacy requirements so that tradeoffs with other areas such as green computing can be dealt with in a more effective manner, and better visualization techniques for making privacy and its tradeoffs more understandable. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll263" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll263',263)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide264" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Finding suitable code for reuse is a common task for programmers. Two general approaches dominate the code search literature: syntactic and semantic. While queries for syntactic search are easy to compose, the results are often vague or irrelevant. On the other hand, a semantic search may return relevant results, but current techniques require developers to write specifications by hand, are costly as potentially matching code need to be executed to verify congruence with the specifications, or only return exact matches. In this work, we propose an approach for semantic search in which programmers specify lightweight, incomplete specifications and an SMT solver automatically identifies programs from a repository, encoded as constraints, that match the specifications. The repository of programs is automatically encoded offline so the search for matching programs is efficient. The program encodings cover various levels of abstraction to enable partial matches when no or few exact matches exists. We instantiate this approach on a subset of the Yahoo! Pipes mashup language, and plan to extend our techniques to more traditional programming languages as the research progresses. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll264" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll264',264)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide266" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Model-driven development, which has recently gained momentum in academia as well as in industry, changed the software engineering process significantly from being code-centric to being model-centric. Models are considered as the key artifacts and as a result the success of the whole software development process relies on these models and their quality. Consequently, there is an urgent need for adequate methods to ensure high quality of models. Model execution can serve as the crucial basis for such methods by enabling to automatically test and debug models. Therefore, lessons learned from testing and debugging of code may serve as a valuable source of inspiration. However, the peculiarities of models in comparison to code, such as multiple views and different abstraction levels, impede the direct adoption of existing methods for models. Thus, we claim that the currently available tool support for model testing and debugging is still insufficient because these peculiarities are not adequately addressed. In this work, we aim at tackling these shortcomings by proposing a novel model execution environment based on fUML, which enables to efficiently test and debug UML models. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll266" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll266',266)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide267" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> There is a growing gap between the software development and operation worlds. Software developers rarely divulge development knowledge about the software to operators, while operators rarely communicate field knowledge to developers. To improve the quality and reduce the operational cost of large-scale software systems, bridging the gap between these two worlds is essential. This thesis proposes the use of logs as mechanism to bridge the gap between these two worlds. Logs are messages generated from statements inserted by developers in the source code and are often used by operators for monitoring the field operation of a system. However, the rich knowledge in logs has not yet been fully used because of their non-structured nature, their large scale, and the use of the ad hoc log analysis techniques. Through case studies on large commercial and open source systems, we plan to demonstrate the value of logs as a tool to support developers and operators. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll267" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll267',267)">expand</a>

A solution to this requirement is the migration of applications between mobile devices at runtime. In our vision to move the application from a device A to a device B, instead of synchronizing just the application's data, a simple swiping gesture can be used. Afterwards the user is able to use the same application including its current state on device B. To achieve this, we plan to put the running application on the device A into a paused state, take a snapshot afterwards, move the application to the device B by using a middleware on both devices, extract the snapshot on device B and finally resume it on device B from its paused state. The outcome of the research will be a framework and either a kernel module or an API to migrate mobile applications. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll270" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll270',270)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide276" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> The technical debt (TD) metaphor describes a tradeoff between short-term and long-term goals in software development. Developers, in such situations, accept compromises in one dimension (e.g. maintainability) to meet an urgent demand in another dimension (e.g. delivering a release on time). Since TD produces interests in terms of time spent to correct the code and accomplish quality goals, accumulation of TD in software systems is dangerous because it could lead to more difficult and expensive maintenance. The research presented in this paper is focused on the usage of automatic static analysis to identify Technical Debt at code level with respect to different quality dimensions. The methodological approach is that of Empirical Software Engineering and both past and current achieved results are presented, focusing on functionality, efficiency and maintainability. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll276" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll276',276)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide277" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Spreadsheets are increasingly used as programming languages, in the construction of large and complex systems. The fact is that spreadsheets, being a highly flexible framework, lack important programming language features such as abstraction or encapsulation. This flexibility, however, comes with a price: spreadsheets are populated with significant amounts of errors. One of the approaches that try to overcome this problem advocates the use of model-driven spreadsheet development: a spreadsheet model is defined, from which a concrete spreadsheet is generated. Although this approach has been proved effective in other contexts, still it needs to accommodate for future evolution of both the model and its instance, so that they remain synchronized at all moments. In this paper, we propose a pair of transformation sets, one working at the model level and the other at the instance level, such that each transformation in one set is related to a transformation in the other set. With our approach, we ensure model/data compliance while allowing for model and data evolution. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll277" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll277',277)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide279" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> Metamodels are commonly used in Model-Driven Engineering to define available model elements and structures. However, metamodels are likely to change during development for various reasons like requirement changes or evolving domain knowledge. Updating a metamodel typically leads to non-conformance issues with existing models. Hence, evolution strategies must be developed. Additionally, the tool implementation must also be updated to support the evolved metamodel. We propose the use of metamodel-independent tools with unified modeling concepts for working with all kinds of metamodels and models. By applying the Constraint-Driven Modeling approach and generating model constraints from metamodels automatically, we solve the described issues and enable dynamic, evolving metamodels. A prototype implementation has shown the feasibility of the approach and performance tests suggest that it also scales with increasing model sizes. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll279" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll279',279)">expand</a>

We aim to assist less skilled developers in composing own mashups by interactively recommending composition knowledge in the form of modeling patterns and fostering knowledge reuse. Our prototype system demonstrates our idea of interactive recommendation and automated pattern weaving, which involves recommending relevant composition patterns to the users during development, and once selected, applying automatically the changes as suggested in the selected pattern to the mashup model under development. The experimental evaluation of our prototype implementation demonstrates that even complex composition patterns can be efficiently stored, queried and weaved into the model under development in browser-based mashup tools. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll280" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll280',280)">expand</a>

We have two explicit goals for the framework: its systematic interception of comprehensive user interactions, and the ease of use in writing customized applications. To this end, we developed IDE++ on top of Eclipse IDE. For evaluation, we built applications upon the framework to illustrate 1) the need for capturing comprehensive, finegrained IDE interactions, and 2) IDE++&#8217;s ease of use.

Systems might become too complex to be managed by humans and, thus, will have to be self-managed: Self-configure themselves for operation, self-protect from attacks, self-heal from errors and self-tune for optimal performance. (Self-)Adaptive systems evaluate their own behavior and change it when the evaluation indicates that it is not accomplishing the software's purpose or when better functionality and performance are possible. </p> <p> To that end, we need to monitor the behavior of the running system and compare it to an explicit formulation of requirements and domain assumptions. Feedback loops (e.g., the MAPE loop) constitute an architectural solution for this and, as proposed by past research, should be a first class citizen in the design of such systems. We advocate that adaptive systems should be designed this way from as early as Requirements Engineering and that reasoning over requirements is fundamental for run-time adaptation. </p> <p> We therefore propose an approach for the design of adaptive systems based on requirements and inspired in control theory. Our proposal is goal-oriented and targets software-intensive socio-technical systems, in an attempt to integrate control-loop approaches with decentralized agents inspired approaches. Our final objective is a set of extensions to state-of-the-art goal-oriented modeling languages that allow practitioners to clearly specify the requirements of adaptive systems and a run-time framework that helps developers implement such requirements. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll284" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll284',284)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide287" style="display:none;"><br /><div style="display:inline"><p> The mining of software repository involves the extraction of both basic and value-added information from existing software repositories. Depending on stakeholders (e.g., researchers, management), these repositories are mined several times for different application purposes. To avoid unnecessary pre-processing steps and improve productivity, sharing, and integration of extracted facts and results are needed. The motivation of this research is to introduce a novel collaborative sharing platform for software datasets that supports on-the-fly inter-datasets integration. We want to facilitate and promote a paradigm shift in the source code analysis domain, similar to the one by Wikipedia in the knowledge-sharing domain. In this paper, we present the SeCold project, which is the first online, publicly available software ecosystem Linked Data dataset. As part of this research, not only theoretical background on how to publish such datasets is provided, but also the actual dataset. SeCold contains about two billion facts, such as source code statements, software licenses, and code clones from over 18.000 software projects. SeCold is also an official member of the Linked Data cloud and one of the eight largest online Linked Data datasets available on the cloud. </p></div></span> <a id="expcoll287" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll287',287)">expand</a>
