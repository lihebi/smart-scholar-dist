Focusing on binary pairwise models, we demonstrate that several recent results on the Bethe approximation may be generalized to a broad family of related pairwise free energy approximations with arbitrary counting numbers. We explore comparisons to the true (Gibbs) free energy and shed light on the empirical success of the Bethe approximation.</div></div><i>Adrian Weller, University of Cambridge</i></td></tr>

The problem consists of tracking a single target given observations about the target that consist of ranked continuous signals, from unlabeled sources in a cluttered environment.  We introduce appropriate factors to handle the imposed ordering assumption, and also incorporate various systematic errors that can arise in this problem, particularly clutter or noise signals as well as missing signals. We show that inference in the obtained graphical model can be simplified by adding bipartite structures with appropriate factors. We apply a hybrid approach consisting of belief propagation and particle filtering in this mixed graphical model for inference and validate the approach on simulated data. We were motivated to formalize and study this problem by a key task in Oceanography, that of tracking the motion of RAFOS ocean floats, using range measurements sent from a set of fixed beacons, but where the identities of the beacons corresponding to the measurements are not known. However, unlike the usual tracking problem in artificial intelligence, there is an implicit ranking assumption among signal arrival times. Our experiments show that the proposed graphical model approach allows us to effectively leverage the problem constraints and improve tracking accuracy over baseline tracking methods yielding results similar to the ground truth hand-labeled data.</div></div><i>Tianyang Li, UT Austin; Harsh Pareek, UT Austin; Pradeep Ravikumar, UT Austin; Dhruv  Balwada, Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Institute at Florida State University; Kevin Speer, Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Institute at Florida State University</i></td></tr>

One common analysis performed on Markov processes is determining their long-run behavior, such as their stationary distributions. While the CTBN can be transformed into a single Markov process of all nodes' state combinations, the size is exponential in the number of nodes, making traditional long-run analysis intractable. To address this, we show how to perform "long-run" node marginalization that removes a node's conditional dependence while preserving its long-run behavior. This allows long-run analysis of CTBNs to be performed in a top-down process without dealing with the entire network all at once.</div></div><i>Liessman Sturlaugson, Montana State University; John Sheppard, Montana State University</i></td></tr>

Based on the test results observed so far, the doctor can either order another test or proceed to the treatment decision. Although test sequencing is a problem that arises frequently in many decision situations, finding an exact solution is NP-hard with respect to n. In this paper, we analyze the time complexity of classic symmetric and asymmetric formulations, using influence diagrams and decision trees, to the general test sequencing problem, making no assumptions of conditional independence among the test results. We develop an alternative influence diagram formulation that scales better, and show how a decision circuit formulation improves on the decision tree solution through recursive coalescence. We prove that this decision circuit formulation achieves the  lower bound complexity for any method for the general test sequencing problem that examines the entire policy space. As a result, the problem is tractable for much larger n than has been possible to date.</div></div><i>Wenhao Liu, Stanford University; Ross Shachter, Stanford University</i></td></tr>

The sought-after prediction aggregate is the equilibrium price. However, traders with budget constraints are restricted in their ability to impact the market price on their own. We give a detailed characterization of optimal trades in the presence of budget constraints in a prediction market with a cost-function-based automated market maker. As a concrete application of our characterization, we give sufficient conditions for a property we call budget additivity: two traders with budgets B and B' and the same beliefs would have a combined impact equal to a single trader with budget B+B'. That way,even if a single trader cannot move the market much, a crowd of like-minded traders can have the same desired effect. We show that a generalization of the heavily-used logarithmic market scoring rule is budget additive for affinely independent pay- offs, but the quadratic market scoring rule is not. Our results may be used both descriptively, to understand if a particular market maker is affected by budget constraints or not, and prescriptively, as a recipe to construct markets.  </div></div><i>Nikhil Devanur, Microsoft Research; Miroslav Dudik, Microsoft Research; Zhiyi Huang, University of Hong Kong; David Pennock, Microsoft Research</i></td></tr>

Cost-sensitive classifiers that attempt to minimize these application-based penalties are needed. We propose a robust minimax approach for producing classifiers that directly minimize the cost of mistakes as a convex optimization problem. This is in contrast to previous methods that minimize the empirical risk using a convex surrogate for the cost of mistakes, since minimizing the empirical risk of the actual cost-sensitive loss is generally intractable. By treating properties of the training data as being uncertain, our approach avoids these computational difficulties. We develop theory and algorithms for our approach and demonstrate its benefits on cost-sensitive classification tasks.</div></div><i>Kaiser Asif, U of Illinois at Chicago; Wei Xing, U of Illinois at Chicago; Sima Behpour, U of Illinois at Chicago; Brian Ziebart, University of Illinois at Chicago</i></td></tr>

The predictions, which are derived from statistics about human actions and identities in real and laboratory environments,  are shared prescriptive and affective behaviours that are believed to lead to solutions to everyday cooperative problems.  A generalisation of ACT, called BayesACT, allows the principles of ACT to be used for human-interactive agents by combining a probabilistic version of the ACT dynamical model of affect with a utility function encoding external goals.  Planning in BayesACT, which we address in this paper, then allows one to go beyond the affective prescription, and leads to the emergence of  more complex interactions between ``cognitive'' reasoning and ``affective'' reasoning, such as deception leading to manipulation and altercasting. We use a continuous variant of a successful Monte-Carlo tree search planner (POMCP), which performs dynamic discretisation of the action and observation spaces while planning.  We present results on two classic two-person social dilemmas, and show how reasoning about affect can produce some remarkably powerful, yet human-like, strategies in these games.   </div></div><i>Nabiha Asghar, University of Waterloo; Jesse Hoey, University of Waterloo</i></td></tr>

Criticising Uncertain Agent Models</b> +<div>The key for effective interaction in many multiagent applications is to reason explicitly about the behaviour of other agents, in the form of a hypothesised behaviour. While there exist several methods for the construction of a behavioural hypothesis, there is currently no universal theory which would allow an agent to contemplate the correctness of a hypothesis. In this work, we present an novel algorithm which decides this question in the form of a frequentist hypothesis test. The algorithm allows for multiple metrics in the construction of the test statistic and learns its distribution during the interaction process, with asymptotic correctness guarantees. We present results from a comprehensive set of experiments, demonstrating that the algorithm achieves high accuracy and scalability at low computational costs.</div></div><i>Stefano Albrecht, The University of Edinburgh; Subramanian Ramamoorthy, The University of Edinburgh</i></td></tr>

Previous analyses of this class of algorithms use ODE techniques to show their asymptotic convergence, and to the best of our knowledge, no finite-sample analysis has been done. Moreover, there has been very little sample complexity analysis for reinforcement learning algorithms in off-policy learning scenarios. In this paper, we formulate the GTD methods as stochastic gradient algorithms w.r.t.~a primal-dual saddle-point objective function, and then conduct a saddle-point error bound analysis to obtain finite-sample error bounds of GTD algorithms family. Two revised algorithms are also proposed as projected GTD2 and GTD2-MP for better convergence guarantee and acceleration, respectively. The results of our theoretical analysis show that the GTD algorithms are indeed comparable to the existing LSTD methods in off-policy learning scenarios. </div></div><i>Bo Liu, University of Massachusetts Am; Ji Liu, University of Rochester; Mohammad Ghavamzadeh, Researcher / Chargé de Recherche (CR1), INRIA Lille - Team SequeL; Sridhar Mahadevan, School of Computer Science University of Massachusetts Amherst; Marek  Petrik, IBM Research</i></td></tr>

The properties of such time series can result in substantial uncertainty about the values of the underlying temporal processes, while making the data difficult to deal with using standard classification methods that assume fixed-dimensional feature spaces. To address these challenges, we propose to first re-represent each time series through the Gaussian process (GP) posterior it induces under a GP regression model. We then define kernels over the space of GP posteriors and apply standard kernel-based classification. Our primary contributions are (i) the development of a kernel between GPs based on the mixture of kernels between their finite marginals, (ii) the development and analysis of extensions of random Fourier features for scaling the proposed kernel to large-scale data, and (iii) an extensive empirical analysis of both the classification performance and scalability of our proposed approach.  </div></div><i>Steven Cheng-Xian Li, UMass Amherst; Benjamin Marlin, UMass Amherst</i></td></tr>

Our first motivation for the extension is about evidential reasoning when the underlying prior knowledge base  is Bayesian. We extend standard Dempster models with prior probabilities to represent beliefs and distinguish between two types of induced mass functions on an extended Dempster model: one for believing and the other essentially for decision-making.  There is a natural correspondence between these two mass functions.  In the extended model, we propose two conditioning rules for evidential reasoning with probabilistic knowledge base.  Our second motivation is about the partial dissociation of betting at the pignistic level from believing at the credal level in TBM.  In our extended TBM, we coordinate these two levels by employing the extended Dempster model to represent beliefs at the credal level. Pignistic probabilities are derived not from the induced mass function for believing but from the one for decision-making in the model and  hence need not reply on the choice of frame of discernment. Moreover, we show that the above two proposed conditionings and marginalization (or coarsening) are consistent with pignistic transformation in the extended TBM.  </div></div><i>Chunlai Zhou, Renmin University of China; Yuan Feng, University of Technology, Sydney</i></td></tr>

When a model does not match the data, predictive accuracy suffers.  We develop population empirical Bayes, a hierarchical framework that explicitly models the empirical population distribution as part of Bayesian analysis. We introduce a latent dataset as a hierarchical variable and set the empirical population as its prior. This leads to a new predictive density that mitigates model mismatch.  We efficiently apply this method to complex models by proposing a stochastic variational inference algorithm, called bumping variational inference.  We demonstrate improved predictive accuracy over classical Bayesian inference in three models: a linear regression model of health data, a Bayesian mixture model of natural images, and a latent Dirichlet allocation topic model of a text corpus.</div></div><i>Alp Kucukelbir, Columbia University; David Blei, Columbia University</i></td></tr>

We show that the mixing time of our Markov chain for Mallows' model is polynomial in $\varphi^{-k_{max}}$, $d_{max}$, and the input size, where $\varphi$ is the dispersion of the model, $k_{max}$ measures agents' largest total bias in bipartitions of alternatives, and $d_{max}$ is the maximum ratio between prior probabilities. We also show that in some cases the mixing time is at least $\Theta(\varphi^{-k_{max}/2})$. For Condorcet's model, our Markov chain is rapid mixing for moderate prior distributions. Efficiency of our algorithms are illustrated by experiments on real-world datasets.</div></div><i>David Hughes, RPI; Kevin Hwang, RPI; Lirong Xia, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</i></td></tr>

Mini-bucket elimination  avoids the space and time complexity of exact  inference by using a top-down partitioning approach  that mimics the construction of a junction  tree and aims to minimize the number of regions  subject to a bound on their size; however,  these methods rarely take into account functions’  values. In contrast, message passing algorithms  often use “cluster pursuit” methods to select regions,  a bottom-up approach in which a predefined  set of clusters (such as triplets) is scored  and incrementally added. In this work, we develop  a hybrid approach that balances the advantages  of both perspectives, providing larger regions  chosen in an intelligent, energy-based way.  Our method is applicable to bounds on a variety  of inference tasks, and we demonstrate its power  empirically on a broad array of problem types.</div></div><i>Sholeh Forouzan, UC, Irvine; Alexander Ihler, UC Irvine</i></td></tr>

One statistic  that received considerable attention is the distance distribution --- the number of   pairs of nodes for each shortest-path distance --- in undirected networks.   determined therefrom; on the other hand, they are closely related to the   dynamics of network spreading processes. It captures important properties of the   network, reflecting on the dynamics of network spreading processes, and   incorporates parameters such as node centrality and (effective) diameter.  So far, however, no parameterization of the distance distribution is known   that applies to a large class of networks.  Here we develop such a closed-form   distribution by applying maximum entropy arguments to derive a general,   physically plausible model of path length histograms. Based on the   model, we then establish the generalized Gamma as a   three-parameter distribution for shortest-path distance  in stronlgy-connected, undirected networks. Extensive experiments corroborate our   theoretical results, which thus provide new approaches to network analysis.  </div></div><i>Christian Bauckhage, Fraunhofer IAIS and University of Bonn; Kristian Kersting, TU Dortmund University; Fabian Hadiji, TU Dortmund University</i></td></tr>

However, long-term dependencies between consecutive states of an environment might exist, which can be exploited during planning. In this paper we propose a scenario representation which enables agents to reason about sequences of future states. We show how weights can be assigned to scenarios, representing the likelihood that scenarios predict future states. Furthermore, we present a model based on a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) to reason about state scenarios during planning. In experiments we show how scenarios and our POMDP model can be used in the context of smart grids and stock markets, and we show that our approach outperforms other methods for decision making in these domains.</div></div><i>Erwin Walraven, Delft University of Technology; Matthijs Spaan, Delft University of Technology</i></td></tr>

Here we consider feature selection for supervised learning problems, where one wishes to select a small set of features that facilitate learning a good prediction model in the reduced feature space. Our interest is primarily in filter methods that select features independently of the learning algorithm to be used and are generally faster to implement than wrapper methods. Many common filter methods for feature selection make use of mutual information based criteria to guide their search process. However, even in simple binary classification problems, mutual information based methods do not always select the best set of features in terms of the Bayes error. In this paper, we develop a filter method that directly aims to select the optimal set of features for a general performance measure of interest. Our approach uses the Bayes error with respect to the given performance measure as the criterion for feature selection and applies a greedy algorithm to optimize this criterion. We demonstrate application of this method to a variety of learning problems involving different performance measures. Experiments suggest the proposed approach is competitive with several state-of-the-art methods.</div></div><i>Saneem Ahmed CG, IBM India Research Lab; Harikrishna Narasimhan, Indian Institute of Science; Shivani Agarwal, Indian Institute of Science</i></td></tr>

The proposed AGD algorithm is applied to learning deep neural networks (DNN) for image recognition in MNIST and speech recognition in Switchboard.

Our approach is based on identifying the state-of-health of a patient given their observed vital signs using a discriminative classifier, and then inferring their underlying physiological values conditioned on this status. The work builds on the Factorial Switching Linear Dynamical System (FSLDS) (Quinn et al., 2009) which has been previously used in a similar setting. The FSLDS is a generative model, whereas the DSLDS is a discriminative model. We demonstrate on two real-world datasets that the DSLDS is able to outperform the FSLDS in most cases of interest, and that an alpha-mixture of the two models achieves higher performance than either of the two models separately.</div></div><i>Konstantinos Georgatzis, University of Edinburgh; Christopher Williams, University of Edinburgh</i></td></tr>

This stochastic branching can be reduced through state abstraction. In online planning with a time budget, there is a complex tradeoff between the loss in performance due to overly coarse abstraction versus the gain in performance from reducing the problem size. We find empirically that very coarse and unsound abstractions often outperform sound abstractions for practical planning budgets. Motivated by this, we propose a progressive abstraction refinement algorithm that refines an initially coarse abstraction during search in order to match the abstraction granularity to the sample budget. Our experiments demonstrate the strong performance of search with coarse abstractions, and show that our proposed algorithm combines the benefits of coarse abstraction at small sample budgets with the ability to exploit larger budgets for further performance gains.</div></div><i>Jesse Hostetler, Oregon State University; Alan Fern, Oregon State University; Thomas Dietterich, Oregon State University</i></td></tr>

We present two new structure learning algorithms for sum-product networks, in the generative and discriminative settings, that are based on recursively extracting rank-one submatrices from data.

In this work, we provide a formalization of temporal relational models. We define temporal extensions to abstract ground graphs---a lifted representation that abstracts paths of dependence over all possible ground graphs. Temporal abstract ground graphs enable a sound and complete method for answering d-separation queries on temporal relational models. These methods provide the foundation for a constraint-based algorithm, TRCD, that learns causal models from temporal relational data.

In this work, we present a simple, general method that gives much more reliable and robust estimates than either IS (AIS) or reverse IS (AIS).

In this paper, we propose a fast relative-error approximation algorithm for ridge regression.

Previous work on covariate shift focuses on matching the marginal distributions on observations $X$ across domains while assuming the conditional distribution $P(Y|X)$ stays the same. Relevant theory focusing on covariate shift has also been developed.    Recent work on transfer learning under model shift deals with different conditional distributions $P(Y|X)$ across domains with a few target labels, while assuming the changes are smooth. However, no analysis has been provided to say when these algorithms work. In this paper, we analyze transfer learning algorithms under the model shift assumption. Our analysis shows that when the conditional distribution changes, we are able to obtain a generalization error bound of $O(\frac{1}{\lambda_* \sqrt{n_l}})$ with respect to the labeled target sample size $n_l$, modified by the smoothness of the change ($\lambda_*$) across domains.

Consequently there has been a push to exploit these statistical dependencies by jointly solving a series of sparse linear inverse problems. In the majority of the resulting algorithms however, we must a priori decide which tasks can most judiciously be grouped together. In contrast, this paper proposes an integrated Bayesian framework for both clustering tasks together and subsequently learning optimally sparse representations within each cluster.  While probabilistic models have been applied previously to solve these types of problems, they typically involve a complex hierarchical Bayesian generative model merged with some type of approximate inference, the combination of which renders rigorous analysis of the underlying behavior virtually impossible. On the other hand, our model subscribes to concrete motivating principles that we carefully evaluate both theoretically and empirically.

Weighted importance sampling (WIS) is generally considered superior to ordinary importance sampling but, when combined with function approximation, it has hitherto required computational complexity that is $O(n^2)$ or more in the number of features. In this paper we introduce new off-policy learning algorithms that obtain most of the benefits of WIS with $O(n)$ computational complexity. Our algorithms maintain for each component of the parameter vector a measure of the extent to which that component has been used in previous examples. This measure is used to determine component-wise step sizes, merging the ideas of stochastic gradient descent and sample averages. We present our main WIS-based algorithm first in an intuitive acausal form (the forward view) and then derive a causal algorithm using eligibility traces that is equivalent but more efficient (the backward view).  In three small experiments, our algorithms performed significantly better than prior $O(n)$ algorithms for off-policy policy evaluation. We also show that our adaptive step-size technique alone can improve the performance of <i>on-policy</i> algorithms such as TD\la and true online TD\la.  </div></div><i>Ashique Rupam Mahmood, University of Alberta; Richard Sutton, University of Alberta</i></td></tr>

In this paper, the problem of finding the most probable state sequence is considered. The state sequence, as opposed to state trajectory, is a sequence of states that the HMM visited but without specifying the dwelling times in these states. This inference problem is relevant in a variety of domains, like text analysis, behavior recognition and etc. However, none of the existing algorithms addresses this inference question adequately.  Previously, the problem of finding the most probable state sequence has been considered within the scope of continuous time Markov chains. Building on that work, we develop a provably correct algorithm, called \textit{state sequence analysis}, that addresses this inference question in HMMs. We discuss and illustrate empirically the differences between finding the most probable state sequence directly and doing so through running Viterbi algorithm and collapsing repetitive state visitations. Two synthetic experimental results demonstrate settings where Viterbi-based approach can be, at times significantly, suboptimal as compared to state sequence analysis. Further, we demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach on a real activity recognition problem. </div></div><i>Yuri Grinberg, Ottawa Hospital Research Inst.; Theodore Perkins, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute</i></td></tr>

Many real problems require large probabilistic graphical models, containing possibly millions of interdependent variables.

In this paper, we explore <i>budgeted online collective inference</i>, in which the MAP configuration of a graphical model is updated efficiently by revising the assignments to a subset of the variables while holding others fixed. The goal is to selectively update certain variables without sacrificing quality with respect to full inference. To formalize the consequences of partially updating inference, we introduce the concept of <i>inference regret</i>. We derive inference regret bounds for a class of graphical models with strongly-convex free energies. These theoretical insights, combined with a thorough analysis of the optimization solver, motivate several new approximate methods for efficiently updating the variable assignments under a budget constraint.

The auditory detection test, for example, seeks to understand a subject's likelihood of hearing sounds as a function of frequency and amplitude. Conventional methods for performing these tests involve testing stimuli on a pre-determined grid. This approach not only samples at very uninformative locations, but also fails to learn critical features of a subject's latent discriminability function.

Even though the equations in such systems only contain O(1) variables each, their sets of solutions (codewords) have excellent statistical properties. By combining these ideas we achieve 100x or greater speedup over the original approach and, perhaps more importantly, levels of accuracy that were completely unattainable.</div></div><i>Dimitris Achlioptas, UCSC; Pei Jiang</i></td></tr>

While Osband et al. derived a bound on the (Bayesian) regret of this method for undiscounted total cost episodic, finite state and action problems,  we consider the continuing, average cost setting with no cardinality restrictions on the state or action spaces.   While in the episodic setting, it is natural to switch to a new policy at the episode-ends,  in the continuing average cost framework we must introduce switching points explicitly and in a principled fashion, or the regret could grow linearly.  Our lazy method introduces these switching points based on monitoring the uncertainty left about the unknown parameter. To develop a suitable and easy-to-compute uncertainty measure,  we introduce a new ``average local smoothness'' condition, which is shown to be satisfied in common examples. Under this, and some additional mild conditions, we derive rate-optimal bounds on the regret of our algorithm.  Our general approach allows us to use a single algorithm and a single analysis for a wide range of problems, such as finite MDPs or linear quadratic regulation, both being instances of smoothly parameterized MDPs.

This enables to confidently ascertain structural independencies in causal graphs, based on the ranking of their most likely contributing nodes with (significantly) positive conditional 3-point information. Starting from a complete undirected graph, dispensible edges are progressively pruned by iteratively `taking off' the most likely positive conditional 3-point information from the 2-point (mutual) information between each pair of nodes. The resulting network skeleton is then partially directed by orienting and propagating edge directions, based on the sign and magnitude of the conditional 3-point information of unshielded triples.

Multitasking problems of this kind are ubiquitous in the  real world, yet very little is known about them from a computational  viewpoint, beyond the basic observation that optimal policies for the  superprocess may prescribe actions that would be suboptimal for an MDP  considered in isolation.  (This observation implies that many  applications of sequential decision analysis in practice are  technically incorrect, since the decision problem being solved is  typically part of a larger, unstated bandit superprocess.) The paper  summarizes the state-of-the-art in the theory of bandit superprocesses  and contributes a novel upper bound on the global value function of a  bandit superprocess, defined in terms of a direct relaxation of the  arms. The bound is equivalent to an existing bound (the Whittle  integral) and so provides insight into an otherwise opaque formula.  We provide an algorithm to compute this bound and use it to derive the  first practical algorithms to select optimal actions in bandit  superprocesses.
