This captures signs of both singleton and edge potentials in a compact and efficiently testable condition, and improves significantly on earlier results. We provide other results on tightness of LP relaxations by forbidding minors, draw connections and suggest paths for future research.</div></div><i>Adrian Weller, University of Cambridge</i></td><tr>

Most previous works model this type of corpus, which are called the semi-structured corpus, without considering the correlations among the tags. In this work, we develop a Correlated Tag Learning (CTL) model for semi-structured corpora based on the topic model to enable the construction of the correlation graph among tags via a logistic normal participation process. For the inference of the CTL model, we devise a variational inference algorithm to approximate the posterior. In experiments, we visualize the tag correlation graph generated by the CTL model on the DBLP corpus and for the tasks of document retrieval and classification, the correlation graph among tags is helpful to improve the generalization performance compared with the state-of-the-art baselines.</div></div><i>Shuangyin Li, HKUST; Rong Pan, Sun Yat-sen University; Yu Zhang, ; Qiang Yang, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology</i></td><tr>

In large-scale ML problems, the parameter matrix of a MPM can grow at an unexpected rate, resulting in high communication and parameter synchronization costs. To address this issue, we offer two contributions: first, we develop a computation model for a large family of MPMs, which share the following property: the parameter update computed on each data sample is a rank-1 matrix, \ie the outer product of two ``sufficient factors" (SFs). Second, we implement a decentralized, peer-to-peer system, Sufficient Factor Broadcasting (SFB), which broadcasts the SFs among worker machines, and reconstructs the update matrices locally at each worker. SFB takes advantage of small rank-1 matrix updates and efficient partial broadcasting strategies to dramatically improve communication efficiency. We propose a graph optimization based partial broadcasting scheme, which minimizes the delay of information dissemination under the constraint that each machine only communicates with a subset rather than all of machines. Furthermore, we provide theoretical analysis to show that SFB guarantees convergence of algorithms (under full broadcasting) without requiring a centralized synchronization mechanism. Experiments corroborate SFB's efficiency on four MPMs.</div></div><i>Pengtao Xie, Carnegie Mellon University; Jin Kyu Kim, Carnegie Mellon University; Yi  Zhou, Syracuse University; Qirong Ho, Institute for Infocomm Research, ASTAR; Abhimanu Kumar, Groupon Inc.; Yaoliang Yu, ; Eric Xing, Carnegie Mellon University</i></td><tr>

The method identifies these unusual climate states on the basis of the relation between ZW and SST patterns without any input about past occurrences of El Nino or La Nina. The simpler alternatives of (i) clustering the SST fields while disregarding their relationship with ZW patterns, or (ii) clustering the joint ZW-SST patterns, do not discover El Nino. We discuss the degree to which our method supports a causal interpretation and use a low-dimensional toy example to explain its success over other clustering approaches. Finally, we propose a new robust and scalable alternative to our original algorithm Chalupka2015b, which circumvents the need for high-dimensional density learning.</div></div><i>Krzysztof Chalupka, Caltech; Tobias Bischoff, Caltech; Frederick Eberhardt, ; Pietro Perona, Caltech</i></td><tr>

To tackle this problem when the data appears sequentially, existing online AUC maximization methods focus on seeking a point estimate of the decision function in a linear or predefined single kernel space, and cannot learn effective kernels automatically from the streaming data. In this paper, we first develop a Bayesian multiple kernel bipartite ranking model, which circumvents the kernel selection problem by estimating a posterior distribution over the model weights. To make our model applicable to streaming data, we then present a kernelized online Bayesian passive-aggressive learning framework by maintaining a variational approximation to the posterior based on data augmentation. Furthermore, to efficiently deal with large-scale data, we design a fixed budget strategy which can effectively control online model complexity. Extensive experimental studies confirm the superiority of our Bayesian multi-kernel approach.</div></div><i>Changying Du, Institute of Software, CAS; Changde Du, ; Guoping Long, ; Qing He, ; Yucheng Li, </i></td><tr>

We introduce global, and ordered local and pairwise Markov properties for the new models. We show the equivalence of these properties for strictly positive probability distributions. We also show that when the random variables are continuous, the new models can be interpreted as systems of structural equations with correlated errors. This enables us to adapt Pearl's do-calculus to them. Finally, we describe an exact algorithm for learning the new models from observational and interventional data via answer set programming.</div></div><i>Jose Pe�a, Link�ping University</i></td><tr>

Instead of taking samples from the variational distribution, we use importance sampling to take samples from an overdispersed distribution in the same exponential family as the variational approximation. Our approach is general since it can be readily applied to any exponential family distribution, which is the typical choice for the variational approximation. We run experiments on two non-conjugate probabilistic models to show that our method effectively reduces the variance, and the overhead introduced by the computation of the proposal parameters and the importance weights is negligible. We find that our overdispersed importance sampling scheme provides lower variance than black-box variational inference, even when the latter uses twice the number of samples. This results in faster convergence of the black-box inference procedure.</div></div><i>Francisco Ruiz, Columbia University; Michalis Titsias, Athens University of Economics and Business; david Blei, Columbia University</i></td><tr>

Since the DS formulation is essentially a linear programming optimization, many existing linear programming solvers can be simply applied for scaling up. The DS formulation can be explained as a basis pursuit denoising problem, wherein the data matrix (or measurement matrix) is employed as the denoising matrix to eliminate the observation noise. However, we notice that the data matrix may not be the optimal denoising matrix, as shown by a simple counter-example. This motivates us to pursue a better denoising matrix for defining a general DS formulation. We first define the optimal denoising matrix through a minimax optimization, which turns out to be an NP-hard problem. To make the problem computationally tractable, we propose a novel algorithm, termed as ``Optimal'' Denoising Dantzig Selector (ODDS), to approximately estimate the optimal denoising matrix. Empirical experiments validate the proposed method. Finally, a novel sparse reinforcement learning algorithm is formulated by extending the proposed ODDS algorithm to temporal difference learning, and empirical experimental results demonstrate to outperform the conventional "vanilla" DS-TD algorithm.</div></div><i>Bo Liu, Auburn University; Luwan Zhang, ; Ji Liu, University of Rochester</i></td><tr>

Mathematically, such decision-makers can be modeled as information-theoretic channels with limited transmission rate. Here, we apply this formalism for the first time to multilayer feedforward neural networks. We derive synaptic weight update rules for two scenarios, where either each neuron is considered as a bounded rational decision-maker or the network as a whole. In the update rules, bounded rationality translates into information-theoretically motivated types of regularization in weight space.In experiments on the MNIST benchmark classification task for handwritten digits, we show that such information-theoretic regularization successfully prevents overfitting across different architectures and attains results that are competitive with other recent techniques like dropout, dropconnect and Bayes by backprop, for both ordinary and convolutional neural networks.</div></div><i>Felix Leibfried, Max Planck Society; Daniel Braun, Max Planck Society</i></td><tr>

Unlike the one-vs.-all strategy, we suggest a unified framework which operates directly  on the multi-class problem without reducing it to a collection of binary tasks. Moreover, this framework makes active learning practically feasible for multi-class problems, while the one-vs.-all strategy cannot. Specifically, we employ a novel randomized query technique to prioritize the informative instances. This query technique based on the hybrid criterion of ``margin" and ``uncertainty" can achieve a comparable mistake bound with its fully supervised counterpart. To take full advantage of correctly predicted labels discarded in traditional conservative algorithms, we propose an aggressive selective sampling algorithm that can update the model even if no error occurs. Thanks to the aggressive updating strategy, the aggressive algorithm attains a lower mistake bound than its conservative competitors in expectation. Encouraging experimental results on real-world graph databases show that the proposed technique by querying an extremely small ratio of labels is able to accomplish better classification accuracy.</div></div><i>Peng Yang, Institute for Infocomm Researc; Peilin Zhao, ; Zhen Hai, Institute for Infocomm Research; Wei Liu, ; Steven C.H.

While this one posterior sample (OPS) approach elegantly provides privacy "for free," it is data inefficient in the sense of asymptotic relative efficiency (ARE).  We show that a simple alternative based on the Laplace mechanism, the workhorse of differential privacy, is as asymptotically efficient as non-private posterior inference, under general assumptions.  This technique also has practical advantages including efficient use of the privacy budget for MCMC.  We demonstrate the practicality of our approach on a time-series analysis of sensitive military records from the Afghanistan and Iraq wars disclosed by the Wikileaks organization.</div></div><i>James Foulds, UC San Diego; Joseph Geumlek, UC San Diego; Max Welling, University of Amsterdam; Kamalika Chaudhuri, </i></td><tr>

We introduce a novel representation of unshielded triples that allows us to efficiently determine whether an RCM is Markov equivalent to another. Under path semantics, we provide a sound and complete algorithm for recovering the structure of an RCM from conditional independence queries.

The generative model associated with the grid does not use these microtopics individually, but in predefined groups which can only be (ad)mixed as such. Each allowed group corresponds to one of all possible overlapping rectangular windows into the grid. The capacity of the model is controlled by the ratio of the grid size and the window size.This paper builds upon the basic counting grid model and it shows that hierarchical reasoning helps avoid bad local minima, produces better classification accuracy and, most interestingly, allows for extraction of large numbers of coherent microtopics even from small datasets. We evaluate this in terms of consistency, diversity and clarity of the indexed content, as well as in a user study on word intrusion tasks. We demonstrate that these models work well as a technique for embedding raw images and discuss interesting parallels between hierarchical CG models and other deep architectures.</div></div><i>Nebojsa Jojic, ; Alessandro Perina, Microsoft; Dongwoo Kim, Australian National University</i></td><tr>

CS reconstructs the compressed signals exactly with overwhelming probability when incoming data can be sparsely represented with a few components. However, the theory of CS framework including random sampling has been focused on exact recovery of signal; impreciseness in signal recovery has been neglected. This can be problematic when there is uncertainty in the number of sparse components such as signal sparsity in dynamic systems that can change over time. We present a new theoretical framework that handles uncertainty in signal recovery from the perspective of recovery success and quality. We show that the signal recovery success in our model is more accurate than the success probability analysis in the CS framework. Our model is then extended to the case where the success or failure of signal recovery can be relaxed. We represent the number of components included in signal recovery with a right-tailed distribution and focus on recovery quality. Experimental results confirm the accuracy of our model in dynamic systems.</div></div><i>Dongeun Lee, UNIST; Rafael de Lima, ; Jaesik Choi, </i></td><tr>

If such an agent is operating in real-time under human supervision, now and then it may be necessary for a human operator to press the big red button to prevent the agent from continuing a harmful sequence of actions---harmful either for the agent or for the environment---and lead the agent into a safer situation. However, if the learning agent expects to receive rewards from this sequence, it may learn in the long run to avoid such interruptions, for example by disabling the red button---which is an undesirable outcome. This paper explores a way to make sure a learning agent will /not/ learn to prevent (or seek!) being interrupted by the environment or a human operator. We provide a formal definition of safe interruptibility and exploit the off-policy learning property to prove that either some agents are already safely interruptible, like Q-learning, or can easily be made so, like Sarsa. We show that even ideal, uncomputable reinforcement learning agents for (deterministic) general computable environments can be made safely interruptible.</div></div><i>Laurent Orseau, Google DeepMind; Stuart Armstrong, Future of Humanity Institute, Oxford, UK</i></td><tr>

These networks admit linear time exact inference, and thus help alleviate one of the chief disadvantages of probabilistic graphical models: accurate probabilistic inference algorithms are often computationally expensive. Although, algorithms for inducing their structure from data have come quite far and often outperform algorithms that induce probabilistic graphical models, a key issue with existing approaches is that they induce tree SPNs, a small, inefficient sub-class of SPNs. In this paper, we address this limitation by developing post-processing approaches that induce graph SPNs from tree SPNs by merging similar sub-structures. The key benefits of graph SPNs over tree SPNs include  smaller computational complexity which facilitates faster online inference, and better generalization accuracy because of reduced variance, at the cost of slight increase in the learning time. We demonstrate experimentally that our merging techniques significantly improve the accuracy of tree SPNs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on several real-world benchmark datasets.</div></div><i>Tahrima Rahman, University of Texas at Dallas; Vibhav Gogate, The University of Texas at Dallas</i></td><tr>

Our method consists in building a fixed-size ensemble, optimizing the configuration of one classifier of the ensemble at each iteration of the hyperparameter optimization algorithm, taking into consideration the interaction with the other models when evaluating potential performances. We also consider the case where the ensemble is to be reconstructed at the end of the hyperparameter optimization phase, through a greedy selection over the pool of models generated during the optimization. We study the performance of our proposed method on three different hyperparameter spaces, showing that our approach is better than both the best single model and a greedy ensemble construction over the models produced by a standard Bayesian optimization.</div></div><i>Julien-Charles Levesque, Universite Laval; Christian Gagne, Universite Laval; Robert Sabourin, Ecole de Technologie Superieure</i></td><tr>

For example, a recommendation engine might perform better when accounting for user profiles, but in the absence of such loyalty data, assumptions would have to be made that increase the complexity of the recommendation policy. A simple greedy recommendation could be implemented based on aggregated user data, but another simple policy can improve on this by accounting for the fact that users come from different segments of a population. In this paper, we study the problem of computing an optimal policy that is interpretable. In particular, we consider a policy to be interpretable if the decisions (e.g., recommendations) depend only on a small number of simple state attributes (e.g., the currently viewed product). This novel model is a general Markov decision problem with action constraints over states. We show that this problem is NP hard and develop a MILP formulation that gives an exact solution when policies are restricted to being deterministic. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on a real-world business case for a European tour operator's recommendation engine.</div></div><i>Marek Petrik, ; Ronny Luss, IBM</i></td><tr>

Recently, Strohmer and Vershynin [J. Fourier Anal. Appl., 15(2):262-278, 2009] gave the first non-asymptotic convergence rate analysis for this algorithm, spurring numerous extensions and generalizations of the Kaczmarz method. Rather than the randomized selection rule analyzed in that work, in this paper we instead discuss greedy and approximate greedy selection rules.

However, to achieve high precision results, one might still need large number of random features, which  is infeasible in large-scale applications. Dai et al.

A drawback of this approach is that the large number of random features slows down the prediction and gradient evaluation after several iterations. We propose two algorithms to remedy this situation by "utilizing" old random features instead of adding new features in certain iterations. By checking the expected descent amount, the proposed algorithm selects "important" old features to update. The resulting procedure is surprisingly simple without enhancing the complexity of the original algorithm but effective in practice.

This approach is motivated by the fact that entities organize themselves into groups having frequent interactions between each other. Unlike previous approaches that focused on subjectively declared relationships, the idea is to exploit the actual evidence at hand to reach conclusions about group formations, resulting in more objective data-driven inferences. To this end, Blundell et. al. (2012) have employed Hawkes processes, and proposed a Hawkes IRM model to infer social structures from interaction data. A major factor that encourages the use of Hawkes processes is the capability to model reciprocity in the interaction between social entities. However, reciprocation is dynamically conditioned upon two key factors: the significance of each message sent by the sender, and the receptivity to each message received by the receiver. In the model proposed by Blundell et. al. (2012), reciprocity is not affected by either of these factors, since the content of each message is not taken into account. In this paper, we extend the work of Blundell et. al. (2012) by introducing Gaussian processes (GPs) into the Hawkes IRM model: based on the content of each message, GPs are used to model the message significance as well as receptivity. This allows us to more accurately capture the interactions among entities. The application of GPs also allows us to flexibly model the rates of reciprocal activities between two entities, allowing asymmetry in reciprocity to be captured more accurately. This leads to better cluster detection capability. Our model outperforms previous Hawkes and Poisson process-based models at predicting verbal, email, and citation activities.</div></div><i>Xi Tan, Purdue University; Syed Naqvi, Purdue University; Yuan, Alan; Qi, ; Katherine Heller, Duke University; vinayak Rao, Purdue University</i></td><tr>

For characteristic kernels, which include most commonly used ones, the kernel mean embedding uniquely determines its probability measure, so it can be used to design a powerful statistical testing framework, which includes nonparametric two-sample and independence tests. In practice, however, the performance of these tests can be very sensitive to the choice of kernel and its lengthscale parameters. To address this central issue, we propose a new probabilistic model for kernel mean embeddings, the Bayesian Kernel Embedding model, combining a Gaussian process prior over the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space containing the mean embedding with a conjugate likelihood function, thus yielding a closed form posterior over the mean embedding. The posterior mean of our model is closely related to recently proposed shrinkage estimators for kernel mean embeddings, while the posterior uncertainty is a new, interesting feature with various possible applications.

To exploit the structure of the optimization problem, we propose a proximal variant of Epro-SGD, namely Epro-ORDA, based on the optimal regularized dual averaging method. We apply the proposed methods on real-world applications; the empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.</div></div><i>Jianhui Chen, Yahoo; Tianbao Yang, University of Iowa; Qihang Lin, ; Lijun Zhang, Nanjing University; Yi Chang, Yahoo!</i></td><tr>

Given that each point can be efficiently expressed using a linear combination of other points from the same subspace, a variety of segmentation algorithms built upon $\ell_1$, nuclear norm, and other convex penalties have recently shown state-of-the-art robustness on multiple benchmarks.  However, what if instead of observing the original data points, we instead only have access to transformed, or `twisted' so to speak, measurements?  Here we consider underdetermined affine transformations that may arise in computer vision applications such as bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) estimation.  Unfortunately most existing approaches, convex or otherwise, do not address this highly useful generalization.  To fill this void, we proceed by deriving a probabilistic model that simultaneously estimates the latent data points and subspace memberships using simple EM update rules.  Moreover, in certain restricted settings this approach is guaranteed to produce the correct clustering.  Finally a wide range of corroborating empirical evidence, including a BRDF estimation task, speaks to the practical efficacy of this algorithm.</div></div><i>David Wipf, Microsoft Research; Yue Dong, Microsoft Research; Bo Xin, Peking University</i></td><tr>

Such mechanisms naturally induce a game in which strategic considerations come into play.  What happens in the game depends on the reasoning power of the experts.  At one extreme, if experts are fully rational, no-trade theorems imply no participation. At the other extreme, if experts ignore strategic considerations, even the least informed will wager as if his beliefs are correct. Economists have analyzed the former case and decision theorists the latter, but both are arguably unrealistic. In this paper, we adopt an intermediate model of bounded rationality in wagering mechanisms based on level-k reasoning. Under this model, overconfidence allows some participation to be sustained, but experts who realize they are at a relative disadvantage do bow out. We derive conditions on the particular wagering mechanism used under which participation is unbiased, and show that unbiasedness always implies truthful reports. We show that if participation is unbiased, then participation rates unavoidably fall as players' rationality increases, vanishing for large k. Finally, we zoom in on one particular information structure to give a complete characterization specifying the conditions under which mechanisms are unbiased and show how to maximize participation rates among all unbiased mechanisms. </div></div><i>David Pennock, Microsoft Research; Vasilis Syrgkanis, Microsoft Research; Jennifer Wortman Vaughan, Microsoft Research</i></td><tr>

We address this heterogeneous adaptation setting using principles from parallel transport and hierarchical sparse coding. By learning generative subspaces from each domain, we first perform label-independent cross-domain feature mapping using parallel transport, and obtain a collection of paths (bridges) that could compensate domain shifts. We encode the information contained in these bridges into an expanded prior, and then integrate the prior into a hierarchical sparse coding framework to learn a selective subset of codes representing holistic data properties that are robust to domain change and feature type variations. We then utilize label information on the sparse codes to perform classification, or in the absence of labels perform clustering, and obtain improved results on several previously studied heterogeneous adaptation datasets. We highlight the flexibility of our approach by accounting for multiple heterogeneous domains in training as well as in testing, and by considering the zero-shot domain transfer scenario where there are data categories in testing which are not seen during training. In that process we also empirically show how existing heterogeneous adaptation solutions can benefit from the findings of our study.</div></div><i>Raghuraman Gopalan, AT&T Research</i></td><tr>

We show that this method reduces the bias of the value-function estimation, leading to faster convergence to the optimal value and the optimal policy. Moreover, G-learning enables the natural incorporation of prior domain knowledge, when available. The stochastic nature of G-learning also makes it avoid some exploration costs, a property usually attributed only to on-policy algorithms.

Although the effect is widely admitted, its theoretical nature remains a mystery to date. This paper presents a first theoretical understanding of n.t. in theory. Under the statistical mini-max framework, we derive lower bounds for the CMF estimator and gain two insights. First, the n.t. effect can be explained as the rise of a bias term in the standard lower bound, which depends only on the structure of factor space but neither the estimator nor samples. Second, the n.t. effect can be explained as the rise of an d_{th}-root function on the learning rate, where d is the dimension of a Grassmannian containing the subspaces spanned by latent factors. These discoveries are also supported in simulation, and suggest n.t. may be more effectively addressed via model construction other than model selection. </div></div><i>Chao Lan, University of Kansas; Jianxin Wang, ; Jun  Huan, University of Kansas</i></td><tr>

To avoid storing the entire matrix Kt, Nystro?m methods subsample a subset of columns of the kernel matrix, and efficiently find an approximate KRR solution on the reconstructed Kt . The chosen subsampling distribution in turn affects the statistical and computational tradeoffs. For KRR problems, [15, 1] show that a sampling distribution proportional to the ridge leverage scores (RLSs) provides strong reconstruction guarantees for Kt. While exact RLSs are as difficult to compute as a KRR solution, we may be able to approximate them well enough. In this paper, we study KRR problems in a sequential setting and introduce the INK-ESTIMATE algorithm, that incrementally computes the RLSs estimates. INK-ESTIMATE maintains a small sketch of Kt, that at each step is used to compute an intermediate es- timate of the RLSs. First, our sketch update does not require access to previously seen columns, and therefore a single pass over the kernel ma- trix is sufficient. Second, the algorithm requires a fixed, small space budget to run dependent only on the effective dimension of the kernel matrix. Finally, our sketch provides strong approximation guarantees on the distance ?Kt?Kt?2 , and on the statistical risk of the approximate KRR solution at any time, because all our guarantees hold at any intermediate step.</div></div><i>Daniele Calandriello, INRIA Lille - Nord Europe; Alessandro Lazaric, ; Michal Valko, Inria Lille - Nord Europe</i></td><tr>

This framework, which we call the MacKay algorithm,  is shown to be closely related to the EM algorithm under certain Gaussian assumption. </div></div><i>Chune Li, Beihang University; Yongyi Mao, University of Ottawa; Richong Zhang, Beihang University; Jinpeng Huai, Beihang University</i></td><tr>

However, existing algorithms which model transitivity suffer from at least one of the following problems: i) they produce graphs of a specific class like bipartite graphs, ii) they do not give an analytical argument for the high clustering coefficient of the model, and iii) their clustering coefficient is still significantly lower than real-world networks. In this paper, we propose a new model for complex networks which is based on adding transitivity to scale-free models. We theoretically analyze the model and provide analytical arguments for its different properties. In particular, we calculate a lower bound on the clustering coefficient of the model which is independent of the network size, as seen in real-world networks. More than theoretical analysis, the main properties of the model are evaluated empirically and it is shown that the model can precisely simulate real-world networks from different domains with and different specifications.</div></div><i>Morteza Haghir Chehreghani, Xerox Research Centre Europe; Mostafa Haghir Chehreghani, KU Leuven</i></td><tr>

While several efficient sparse GP models are known, they have limitations when applied in optimization settings.We propose a novel Bayesian optimization framework that uses sparse online Gaussian processes. We introduce a new updating scheme for the online GP that accounts for our preference during optimization for regions with better performance. We apply this method to optimize the performance of a free-electron laser, and demonstrate empirically that the weighted updating scheme leads to substantial improvements to performance in optimization.</div></div><i>Mitchell McIntire, Stanford University; Daniel Ratner, SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory; Stefano Ermon, </i></td><tr>

It is novel in several ways: (a) it takes linear time and constant space to compute on the fly, (b) it has the same power guarantee as a nonsequential version of the test with the same computational constraints up to a small factor, and (c) it accesses only as many samples as are required - its stopping time adapts to the unknown difficulty of the problem. All our test statistics are constructed to be zero-mean martingales under the null hypothesis, and the rejection threshold is governed by a uniform non-asymptotic law of the iterated logarithm (LIL). For the case of nonparametric two-sample mean testing, we also provide a finite sample power analysis, and the first non-asymptotic stopping time calculations for this class of problems. We verify our predictions for type I and II errors and stopping times using simulations.</div></div><i>Akshay Balsubramani, UC San Diego; Aaditya Ramdas, UC Berkeley</i></td><tr>

Our approach is deeply rooted in Stochastic Portfolio Theory (SPT), a stochastic analysis framework recently introduced by Robert Fernholz that aims at flexibly analysing the performance of certain investment strategies in stock markets relative to benchmark indices. In particular, SPT has exhibited some investment strategies based on company sizes that, under realistic assumptions, outperform benchmark indices with probability 1 over certain time horizons. Galvanised by this result, we consider the inverse problem that consists of learning (from historical data) an optimal investment strategy based on any given set of trading characteristics, and using a user-specified optimality criterion that may go beyond outperforming a benchmark index. Although the inverse problem is of the utmost interest to investment management practitioners, it can hardly be tackled using the SPT framework. We show that our machine learning approach learns investment strategies that considerably outperform existing SPT strategies in the US stock market.</div></div><i>Yves-Laurent Kom Samo, University of Oxford; Alexander Vervuurt, University of Oxford</i></td><tr>

Planning in such  systems   becomes  challenging   in  the   absence   of  inter-agent  communication because  agents must predict  if others have  left the  system or new agents are  now present to decide on possibly choosing  a  different line  of action.

With the help  of a realistic  domain  --  wildfire  suppression   --  we  motivate  the  need  for  individual  planning  in  open  environments  and  present  a  first  approach for  robust decision-theoretic planning  in such multiagent  systems.

Rather than draw a random sample, our approach performs an online optimization which aims to select the subset that provides the best overall approximation to the full data set, as judged using a kernel two-sample test. This produces subsets which minimize the worst-case relative error when computing expectations of functions in a specified function class, using just the samples from the subset. Kernel functions are approximated using random Fourier features, and the subset of samples itself is stored in a random projection tree. The resulting algorithm runs in a single pass through the whole data set, and has a per-iteration computational complexity logarithmic in the size of the subset. These "super-samples" subsampled from the full data provide a concise summary, as demonstrated empirically on mixture models and the MNIST dataset.</div></div><i>Brooks Paige, University of Oxford; Dino Sejdinovic, University of Oxford; Frank Wood, University of Oxford</i></td><tr>

We then approximate the continuous MDP using finer and finer discretizations. Doing this results in a family of systems, each of which has an extremely large action space, although only a few actions are "interesting". We can view the decision maker as being unaware of which actions are "interesting". We an model this using MDPUs, MDPs with unawareness, where the action space is much smaller. As we show, MDPUs can be used as a general framework for learning tasks in robotic problems. We prove results on the difficulty of learning a near-optimal policy in an an MDPU for a continuous task. We apply these ideas to the problem of having a humanoid robot learn on its own how to walk.</div></div><i>Nan Rong, Cornell University; Joseph Halpern, Cornell University; Ashutosh Saxena, Cornell University</i></td><tr>

We address two questions of identifiability: the identifiability of the causal direction between two variables in the presence of selection bias, and, given the causal direction, the identifiability of the model with outcome-dependent selection. Regarding the first, we show that in the framework of post-nonlinear causal models, once outcome-dependent selection is properly modeled, the causal direction between two variables is generically identifiable; regarding the second, we identify some mild conditions under which an additive noise causal model with outcome-dependent selection is to a large extent identifiable. We also propose two methods for estimating an additive noise model from data that are generated with outcome-dependent selection.</div></div><i>Kun Zhang, cmu; Jiji Zhang, ; Biwei Huang, MPI; Bernhard Schoelkopf, ; Clark Glymour, CMU</i></td><tr>

However, as is now well-known, inference complexity is one of the main bottlenecks in MLNs. Recently, several approaches have been proposed that exploit approximate symmetries in the MLN to reduce inference complexity. These approaches approximate large domains containing many objects with much smaller domains of meta-objects (or cluster-centers), so that inference is considerably faster and more scalable. However, a drawback in most of these approaches is that it is typically very hard to tune the parameters (e.g., number of clusters) such that inference is both efficient and accurate. Here, we propose a novel non-parametric approach that trades-off solution quality with efficiency to automatically learn the optimal domain approximation. Further, we show how to perform Gibbs sampling effectively in a domain-approximated MLN by adapting the sampler according to the approximation. Our results on several benchmarks show that our approach is scalable, accurate and converges faster than existing methods.</div></div><i>Deepak Venugopal, The University of Memphis; Somdeb Sarkhel, ; Kyle Cherry, </i></td><tr>

The information bottleneck (IB) by Tishby, Pereira, and Bialek formalized this notion as an information-theoretic optimization problem and proposed an optimal tradeoff between throwing away as many bits as possible, and selectively keeping those that are most important. Here, we introduce an alternative formulation, the deterministic information bottleneck (DIB), that we argue better captures this notion of compression. As suggested by its name, the solution to the DIB problem is a deterministic encoder, as opposed to the stochastic encoder that is optimal under the IB. We then compare the IB and DIB on synthetic data, showing that the IB and DIB perform similarly in terms of the IB cost function, but that the DIB vastly outperforms the IB in terms of the DIB cost function. Moreover, the DIB offered a 1-2 order of magnitude speedup over the IB in our experiments. Our derivation of the DIB also offers a method for continuously interpolating between the soft clustering of the IB and the hard clustering of the DIB.</div></div><i>DJ Strouse, Princeton University; david Schwab, Northwestern University</i></td><tr>
