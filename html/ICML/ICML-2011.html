<span class='name'>Wei Liu, Jun Wang, Sanjiv Kumar, Shih-Fu Chang</span>
<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>Hashing is becoming increasingly popular for efficient nearest neighbor search in massive databases. However, learning short codes that yield good search performance is still a challenge. Moreover, in many cases real-world data lives on a low-dimensional manifold, which should be taken into account to capture meaningful nearest neighbors.  In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based hashing method which automatically discovers the neighborhood structure inherent in the data to learn appropriate compact codes. To make such an approach computationally feasible, we utilize Anchor Graphs to obtain tractable low-rank adjacency matrices. Our formulation allows constant time hashing of a new data point by extrapolating graph Laplacian eigenvectors to eigenfunctions. Finally, we describe a hierarchical threshold learning procedure in which each eigenfunction yields multiple bits, leading to higher search accuracy. Experimental comparison with the other state-of-the-art methods on two large datasets demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed method. </p>

<span class='name'>Wenliang Zhong, James Kwok</span>
<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>The grouping of features is highly beneficial in learning with high-dimensional data. It reduces the variance in the estimation and improves the stability of feature selection, leading to improved generalization. Moreover, it can also help in data understanding and interpretation. OSCAR is a recent sparse modeling tool that achieves this by using a $\ell_1$-regularizer and a pairwise $\ell_\infty$-regularizer. However, its optimization is computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose an efficient solver based on the accelerated gradient methods.  We show that its key projection step can be solved by a simple iterative group merging algorithm. It is highly efficient and reduces the empirical time complexity from $O(d^3 \sim d^5)$ for the existing solvers to just $O(d)$, where $d$ is the number of features. Experimental results on toy and real-world data sets demonstrate that OSCAR is a competitive sparse modeling approach with the added ability of automatic feature grouping. </p>

<span class='name'>Wei Bi, James Kwok</span>
<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>Many real-world applications involve multi-label classification, in which the labels are organized in the form of a tree or directed acyclic graph (DAG). However, current research efforts typically ignore the label dependencies or can only exploit the dependencies in tree-structured hierarchies. In this paper, we present a novel hierarchical multi-label classification algorithm which can be used on both tree- and DAG-structured hierarchies. The key idea is to formulate the search for the optimal consistent multi-label as the finding of the best subgraph in a tree/DAG. Using a simple greedy strategy, the proposed algorithm is computationally efficient, easy to implement, does not suffer from the problem of insufficient/skewed training data in classifier training, and can be readily used on large hierarchies. Theoretical results guarantee the optimality of the obtained solution. Experiments are performed on a large number of functional genomics data sets. The proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art method on both tree- and DAG-structured hierarchies. </p>

<a name='38'><h3 style='margin-top:6ex;'>A Graph-based Framework for Multi-Task Multi-View Learning </h3>
<span class='name'>Jingrui He, Rick Lawrence</span>
<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>Many real-world problems exhibit dual-heterogeneity. A single learning task might have features in multiple views (i.e., feature heterogeneity); multiple learning tasks might be related with each other through one or more shared views (i.e., task heterogeneity). Existing multi-task learning or multi-view learning algorithms only capture one type of heterogeneity.  In this paper, we introduce Multi-Task Multi-View (M^2TV) learning for such complicated learning problems with both feature heterogeneity and task heterogeneity. We propose a graph-based framework (GraM^2) to take full advantage of the dual-heterogeneous nature. Our framework has a natural connection to Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). Furthermore, we propose an iterative algorithm (IteM^2) for GraM^2 framework, and analyze its optimality, convergence and time complexity. Experimental results on various real data sets demonstrate its effectiveness.  </p>

<span class='name'>Tianyi Zhou, Dacheng Tao, University of Technology</span>
<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>Low-rank and sparse structures have been profoundly studied in matrix completion and compressed sensing. In this paper, we develop ``Go Decomposition'' (GoDec) to efficiently and robustly estimate the low-rank part $L$ and the sparse part $S$ of a matrix $X=L+S+G$ with noise $G$. GoDec alternatively assigns the low-rank approximation of $X-S$ to $L$ and the sparse approximation of $X-L$ to $S$. The algorithm can be significantly accelerated by bilateral random projections (BRP). We also propose GoDec for matrix completion as an important variant. We prove that the objective value $\|X-L-S\|_F^2$ converges to a local minimum, while $L$ and $S$ linearly converge to local optimums. Theoretically, we analyze the influence of $L$, $S$ and $G$ to the asymptotic/convergence speeds in order to discover the robustness of GoDec. Empirical studies suggest the efficiency, robustness and effectiveness of GoDec comparing with representative matrix decomposition and completion tools, e.g., Robust PCA and OptSpace. </p>

<span class='name'>Jia Yuan Yu, Shie Mannor</span>
<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>We consider multiarmed bandit problems where the expected reward is   unimodal over partially ordered arms. In particular, the   arms may belong to a continuous interval or correspond to vertices   in a graph, where the graph structure represents similarity in rewards.   The unimodality assumption has an important   advantage: we can determine if a given arm is optimal by sampling   the possible directions around it. This property allows us to   quickly and efficiently find the optimal arm and detect abrupt changes in the reward distributions.   For the case of bandits on graphs, we incur a regret proportional to the   maximal degree and the diameter of the graph, instead of the total number of vertices. </p>

<a name='54'><h3 style='margin-top:6ex;'>Learning Output Kernels with Block Coordinate Descent </h3>
<span class='name'>Francesco Dinuzzo, Cheng Soon Ong, Peter Gehler, Gianluigi Pillonetto</span>
<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>We propose a method to learn simultaneously a vector-valued function and a kernel between its components. The obtained kernel can be used both to improve learning performances and to reveal structures in the output space which may be important in their own right. Our method is based on the solution of a suitable regularization problem over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) of vector-valued functions. Although the regularized risk functional is non-convex, we show that it is invex, implying that all local minimizers are global minimizers. We derive a block-wise coordinate descent method that efficiently exploits the structure of the objective functional. Then, we empirically demonstrate that the proposed method can improve classification accuracy. Finally, we provide a visual interpretation of the learned kernel matrix for some well known datasets.  </p>

<span class='name'>Ha Quang Minh, Vikas Sindhwani</span>
<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>We consider the general problem of learning an unknown functional dependency, f : X->Y, between a structured input space X and a structured output space Y, from labeled and unlabeled examples. We formulate this problem in terms of data-dependent regularization in Vector-valued Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (Micchelli & Pontil, 2005) which elegantly extend familiar scalar-valued kernel methods to the general setting where Y has a Hilbert space structure. Our methods provide a natural extension of Manifold Regularization (Belkin et al., 2006) algorithms to also exploit output inter-dependencies while enforcing smoothness with respect to input data geometry. We propose a class of matrix-valued kernels which allow efficient implementations of our algorithms via the use of numerical solvers for Sylvester matrix equations. On multilabel image annotation and text classification problems, we find favorable empirical comparisons against several competing alternatives. </p>

<span class='name'>Masashi Sugiyama, Makoto Yamada, Manabu Kimura, Hirotaka Hachiya</span>
<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>Information-maximization clustering learns a probabilistic classifier in an unsupervised manner so that mutual information between feature vectors and cluster assignments is maximized. A notable advantage of this approach is that it only involves continuous optimization of model parameters, which is substantially easier to solve than discrete optimization of cluster assignments. However, existing methods still involve non-convex optimization problems, and therefore finding a good local optimal solution is not straightforward in practice. In this paper, we propose an alternative information-maximization clustering method based on a squared-loss variant of mutual information. This novel approach gives a clustering solution analytically in a computationally efficient way via kernel eigenvalue decomposition. Furthermore, we provide a practical model selection procedure that allows us to objectively optimize tuning parameters included in the kernel function. Through experiments, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach.  </p>

<a name='63'><h3 style='margin-top:6ex;'>On tracking portfolios with certainty equivalents on  a generalization of Markowitz model: the Fool, the Wise and the Adaptive </h3>
<span class='name'>Richard Nock, Brice Magdalou, Eric Briys, Frank Nielsen</span>
<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>Portfolio allocation theory has been heavily influenced by a major contribution of Harry Markowitz in the early fifties: the mean-variance approach. While there has been a continuous line of works in on-line learning portfolios over the past decades, very few works have really tried to cope with Markowitz model. A major drawback of the mean-variance approach is that it is approximation-free only when stock returns obey a Gaussian distribution, an assumption known not to hold in real data. In this paper, we first alleviate this assumption, and rigorously lift the mean-variance model to a more general mean-divergence model in which stock returns are allowed to obey any exponential family of distributions. We then devise a general on-line learning algorithm in this setting. We prove for this algorithm the first lower bounds on the most relevant quantity to be optimized in the framework of Markowitz model: the certainty equivalents. Experiments on four real-world stock markets  display its ability to track portfolios whose cumulated returns exceed those of the best stock by orders of magnitude. </p>

<a name='74'><h3 style='margin-top:6ex;'>Multiple Instance Learning with Manifold Bags </h3>
<span class='name'>Boris Babenko, Nakul Verma, Piotr Dollar, Serge Belongie</span>
<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>In many machine learning applications, labeling every instance of data is burdensome. Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), in which training data is provided in the form of labeled bags rather than labeled instances, is one approach for a more relaxed form of supervised learning.  Though much progress has been made in analyzing MIL problems, existing work considers bags that have a finite number of instances.  In this paper we argue that in many applications of MIL (e.g. image, audio, e.t.c.) the bags are better modeled as low dimensional manifolds in high dimensional feature space.  We show that the geometric structure of such manifold bags affects  PAC-learnability. We discuss how a learning algorithm that is designed for finite sized bags can be adapted to learn from manifold bags.  Furthermore, we propose a simple heuristic that reduces the memory requirements of such algorithms.  Our experiments on real-world data validate our analysis and show that our approach works well. </p>

<span class='name'>Yi Jiang, Jiangtao Ren</span>
<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>In recent years, some spectral feature selection methods are proposed to choose those features with high power of preserving sample similarity. However, when there exist lots of irrelevant or noisy features in data, the similarity matrix constructed from all the un-weighted features may be not reliable, which then misleads existing spectral feature selection methods to select 'wrong' features. To solve this problem, we propose that feature importance should be evaluated according to their impacts on similarity matrix, which means features with high impacts on similarity matrix should be chosen as important ones. Since graph Laplacian\cite{luxbury2007} is defined on the similarity matrix, then the impact of each feature on similarity matrix can be reflected on the change of graph Laplacian, especially on its eigen-system. Based on this point of view, we propose an Eigenvalue Sensitive Criteria (EVSC) for feature selection, which aims at seeking those features with high impact on graph Laplacian's eigenvalues. Empirical analysis demonstrates our proposed method outperforms some traditional spectral feature selection methods.  </p>

<span class='name'>Jiang Su, Jelber Sayyad Shirab, Stan Matwin</span>
<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>Numerous semi-supervised learning methods have been proposed to augment Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) using unlabeled documents, but their use in practice is often limited due to implementation difficulty, inconsistent prediction performance, or high computational cost. In this paper, we propose a new, very simple semi-supervised extension of MNB, called Semi-supervised Frequency Estimate (SFE). Our experiments show that it consistently improves MNB with additional data (labeled or unlabeled) in terms of AUC and accuracy, which is not the case when combining MNB with Expectation Maximization (EM). We attribute this to the fact that SFE consistently produces better conditional log likelihood values than both EM+MNB and MNB in labeled training data. </p>

<span class='name'>KyungHyun Cho, Tapani Raiko, Alexander Ilin</span>
<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>Boltzmann machines are often used as building blocks in greedy learning of deep networks. However, training even a simplified model, known as restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), can be extremely laborious: Traditional learning algorithms often converge only with the right choice of the learning rate scheduling and the scale of the initial weights. They are also sensitive to specific data representation: An equivalent RBM can be obtained by flipping some bits and changing the weights and biases accordingly, but traditional learning rules are not invariant to such transformations. Without careful tuning of these training settings, traditional algorithms can easily get stuck at plateaus or even diverge. In this work, we present an enhanced gradient which is derived such that it is invariant to bit-flipping transformations. We also propose a way to automatically adjust the learning rate by maximizing a local likelihood estimate. Our experiments confirm that the proposed improvements yield more stable training of RBMs. </p>

<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>This paper proposes a novel Linear Programming (LP) based algorithm, called Dynamic Tree-Block Coordinate Ascent (DTBCA), for performing maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference in probabilistic graphical models. Unlike traditional message passing algorithms, which operate uniformly on the whole factor graph, our method dynamically chooses regions of the factor graph on which to focus message-passing efforts. We propose two criteria for selecting regions, including an efficiently computable upper-bound on the increase in the objective possible by passing messages in any particular region. This bound is derived from the theory of primal-dual methods from combinatorial optimization, and the forest that maximizes the bounds can be chosen efficiently using a maximum-spanning-tree-like algorithm. Experimental results show that our dynamic schedules significantly speed up state-of-the- art LP-based message-passing algorithms on a wide variety of real-world problems. </p>

<span class='name'>Michael Mahoney, Lorenzo Orecchia</span>
<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>Regularization is a powerful technique for extracting useful information from noisy data.  Typically, it is implemented by adding some sort of norm constraint to an objective function and then exactly optimizing the modified objective   function.  This procedure often leads to optimization problems that are computationally more expensive than the original problem, a fact that is clearly problematic if one is interested in large-scale applications.  On the other hand, a large body of empirical work has demonstrated that heuristics, and in some cases approximation algorithms, developed to speed up computations sometimes have the side-effect of performing regularization implicitly.  Thus, we consider the question: What is the regularized optimization objective that an approximation algorithm is exactly optimizing?  We address this question in the context of computing approximations to the smallest nontrivial eigenvector of a graph Laplacian; and we consider three random-walk-based procedures: one based on the heat kernel of the graph, one based on computing the the PageRank vector associated with the graph, and one based on a truncated lazy random walk.  In each case, we provide a precise characterization of the manner in which the approximation method can be viewed as implicitly computing the exact solution to a regularized problem.  Interestingly, the regularization is not on the usual vector form of the optimization problem, but instead it is on a related semidefinite program. </p>

<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>Recursive structure is commonly found in the inputs of different modalities such as natural scene images or natural language sentences. Discovering this recursive structure helps us to not only identify the units that an image or sentence contains but also how they interact to form a whole. We introduce a max-margin structure prediction architecture based on recursive neural networks that can successfully recover such structure both in complex scene images as well as sentences. The same algorithm can be used both to provide a competitive syntactic parser for natural language sentences from the Penn Treebank and to outperform alternative approaches for semantic scene segmentation, annotation and classification. For segmentation and annotation our algorithm obtains a new level of state-of-the-art performance on the Stanford background dataset (78.1%). The features from the image parse tree outperform Gist descriptors for scene classification by 4%. </p>

However, existing methods require restrictive data models for evidence about user preferences. We relax these restrictions by considering as data arbitrary pairwise comparisons---the fundamental building blocks of ordinal rankings. We develop the first algorithms for learning Mallows models (and mixtures) with pairwise comparisons. At the heart is a new algorithm, the generalized repeated insertion model (GRIM), for sampling from arbitrary ranking distributions. We develop approximate samplers that are exact for many important special cases---and have provable bounds with pairwise evidence---and derive algorithms for evaluating log-likelihood, learning Mallows mixtures, and non-parametric estimation. Experiments on large, real-world datasets show the effectiveness of our approach.  </p>

<span class='name'>Pratik Jawanpuria, Saketha Nath Jagarlapudi, Ganesh Ramakrishnan</span>
<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>This paper addresses the problem of Rule Ensemble Learning (REL), where the goal is simultaneous discovery of a small set of simple rules and their optimal weights that lead to good generalization. Rules are assumed to be conjunctions of basic propositions  concerning the values taken by the input features. From the perspectives of interpretability as well as generalization, it is highly desirable to construct rule ensembles with low training error, having rules that are i) simple, {\em i.e.}, involve few conjunctions and ii) few in number. We propose to explore the (exponentially) large feature space of all possible conjunctions optimally and efficiently by employing the recently introduced Hierarchical Kernel Learning (HKL) framework. The regularizer employed in the HKL formulation can be interpreted as a potential for discouraging selection of rules involving large number of conjunctions -- justifying its suitability for constructing rule ensembles. Simulation results show that the proposed approach improves over state-of-the-art REL algorithms in terms of generalization and indeed learns simple rules. Although this is encouraging, it can be shown that HKL selects a conjunction only if all its subsets are selected, and this is highly undesirable. We propose a novel convex formulation which alleviates this problem and generalizes the HKL framework. The main technical contribution of this paper is an efficient mirror-descent based active set algorithm for solving the new formulation. Empirical evaluations on REL problems illustrate the utility of generalized HKL. </p>

Classifying human motions is a critical task in motion editing and synthesizing, for which manual labeling is clearly inefficient for large databases. Here we study the general problem of time series clustering. We propose a novel method of clustering time series that can (a) learn joint temporal dynamics in the data; (b) handle time lags; and (c) produce interpretable features. We achieve this by developing complex-valued linear dynamical systems (CLDS), which include real-valued Kalman filters as a special case; our advantage is that the transition matrix is simpler (just diagonal), and the transmission one easier to interpret. We then present Complex-Fit, a novel EM algorithm to learn the parameters for the general model and its special case for clustering.

This requires exact MAP inference, which is intractable for many classes of MRF.   In this paper, we propose an exact MAP inference algorithm for binary MRFs containing a class of higher-order models, known as lower linear envelope potentials. Our algorithm is polynomial in the number of variables and number of linear envelope functions.  With tractable inference in hand, we show how the parameters and corresponding feature vectors can be represented in a max-margin framework for efficiently learning lower linear envelope potentials. </p>

To address the scalability problem of NPKL, we propose a novel algorithm called BCDNPKL, which is very efficient and scalable. Superior to most existing approaches, BCDNPKL keeps away from semidefinite programming (SDP) and eigen-decomposition, which benefits from two findings: 1) The original SDP framework of NPKL can be reduced into a far smaller-sized counterpart which is corresponding to the sub-kernel (referred to as boundary kernel) learning; 2) The sub-kernel learning can be efficiently solved by using the proposed block coordinate descent (BCD) technique. We provide a formal proof of global convergence for the proposed BCDNPKL algorithm. The extensive experiments verify the scalability and effectiveness of BCDNPKL, compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms. </p>

We address this limitation by developing online learning algorithm for maximizing Area Under the ROC curve (AUC), a metric that is widely used for measuring the classification performance for imbalanced data distributions. The key challenge of online AUC maximization is that it needs to optimize the pairwise loss between two instances from different classes. This is in contrast to the classical setup of online learning where the overall loss is a sum of losses over individual training examples. We address this challenge by exploiting the reservoir sampling technique, and present two algorithms for online AUC maximization with theoretic performance guarantee. Extensive experimental studies confirm the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed algorithms for maximizing AUC.  </p>

In this paper we look at the MKL problem at the same time from a learning and optimization point of view. So, instead of designing a regularizer and then struggling to find an efficient method to minimize it, we design the regularizer while keeping the optimization algorithm in mind. Hence, we introduce a novel MKL formulation, which mixes elements of p-norm and elastic-net kind of regularization. We also propose a fast stochastic gradient descent method that solves the novel MKL formulation. We show theoretically and empirically that our method has 1) state-of-the-art performance on many classification tasks; 2) exact sparse solutions with a tunable level of sparsity; 3) a convergence rate bound that depends only logarithmically on the number of kernels used, and is independent of the sparsity required; 4) independence on the particular convex loss function used. </p>

Past Bayes Point machines have overcome the intractability of this goal by using message passing techniques that approximate the posterior of the classifier parameters as a Gaussian distribution. In this paper, we investigate alternative message passing approaches that do not rely on Gaussian approximation. To make this possible, we introduce a new computational shortcut based on linear multiple-choice knapsack problems that reduces the complexity of computing Bayes Point belief propagation messages from exponential to linear in the number of data features. Empirical tests of our approach show significant improvement in linear classification over both soft-margin SVMs and Expectation Propagation Bayes Point machines for several real-world UCI datasets. </p>

Despite its ease of implementation, SGDs are difficult to tune and parallelize. These problems make it challenging to develop, debug and scale up deep learning algorithms with SGDs. In this paper, we show that more sophisticated off-the-shelf optimization methods such as Limited memory BFGS (L-BFGS) and Conjugate gradient (CG) with linesearch can significantly simplify and speed up the process of pretraining deep algorithms. In our experiments, the difference between L-BFGS/CG and SGDs are more pronounced if we consider algorithmic extensions (e.g., sparsity regularization) and hardware extensions (e.g., GPUs or computer clusters). Our experiments with distributed optimization support the use of L-BFGS with locally connected networks and convolutional neural networks. Using L-BFGS, our convolutional network model achieves 0.69\% on the standard MNIST dataset.

We analyze this algorithm in a partial adversarial setting, where   instances are chosen adversarially, while the labels are chosen   according to a linear probabilistic model, which is also chosen   adversarially. From the theoretical viewpoint, we show a regret of O(\sqrt{T}\log(T)), which improves   over the current best bounds of O(T^{2/3}) in the fully   adversarial setting.

<span class='name'>Dave Helmbold, Phil Long</span>
<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>This work explores the effects of relevant and irrelevant boolean variables on the accuracy of classifiers.  The analysis uses the assumption that the variables are conditionally independent given the class, and focuses on a natural family of learning algorithms for such sources when the relevant variables have a small advantage over random guessing.  The main result is that algorithms relying predominately on irrelevant variables have error probabilities that quickly go to 0 in situations where algorithms that limit the use of irrelevant variables have errors bounded below by a positive constant.  We also show that accurate learning is possible even when there are so few examples that one cannot determine with high confidence whether or not any individual variable is relevant.  </p>

<span class='name'>Simon Barthelm�, Nicolas Chopin</span>
<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>Many statistical models of interest to the natural and social sciences have no tractable likelihood function. Until recently, Bayesian inference for such models was thought infeasible. Pritchard et al. (1999) introduced an algorithm known as ABC, for Approximate Bayesian Computation, that enables Bayesian computation in such models. Despite steady progress since this first breakthrough, such as the adaptation of MCMC and Sequential Monte Carlo techniques to likelihood-free inference, state-of-the art methods remain notoriously hard to use and require enormous computation times. Among other issues, one faces the difficult task of finding appropriate summary statistics for the model, and tuning the algorithm can be time-consuming when little prior information is available. We show that Expectation Propagation, a widely successful approximate inference technique, can be adapted to the likelihood-free context. The resulting algorithm does not require summary statistics, is an order of magnitude faster than existing techniques, and remains usable when prior information is vague.  </p>

<span class='name'>Aviv Tamar, Dotan Di Castro, Ron Meir</span>
<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>In reinforcement learning an agent uses online feedback from the environment and prior knowledge in order to adaptively select an effective policy. Model free approaches address this task by directly mapping external and internal states to actions, while model based methods attempt to construct a model of the environment, followed by a selection of optimal actions based on that model. Given the complementary advantages of both approaches, we suggest a novel algorithm which combines them into a single algorithm, which switches between a model based and a model free mode, depending on the current environmental state and on the status of the agent's knowledge. We prove that such an approach leads to improved performance whenever environmental knowledge is available, without compromising performance when such knowledge is absent. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach and suggest its efficacy in boosting policy gradient learning. </p>

<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>Numerous applications in statistics, signal processing, and machine learning regularize using Total Variation (TV) penalties. We study anisotropic (l1-based) TV and also a related l2-norm variant.  We consider for both variants associated (1D) proximity operators, which lead to challenging optimization problems. We solve these problems by developing Newton-type methods that outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms. More importantly, our 1D-TV algorithms serve as building blocks for solving the harder task of computing 2- (and higher)-dimensional TV proximity. We illustrate the computational benefits of our methods by applying them to several applications: (i) image denoising; (ii) image deconvolution (by plugging in our TV solvers into publicly available software); and (iii) four variants of fused-lasso. The results show large speedups--and to support our claims, we provide software accompanying this paper. </p>

In many settings, however, nonlinear costs are more realistic. Owing to their non-separability, these lead to much harder optimization problems. Going beyond linearity, we address online approximation algorithms for structured concepts that allow the cost to be submodular, i.e., nonseparable. In particular, we show regret bounds for three Hannan-consistent strategies that capture different settings. Our results also tighten a regret bound for unconstrained online submodular minimization.  </p>

The goal is to jointly minimize the cost of both learning and covering.  We extend recent work in this setting to allow for a limited amount of adversarial noise. Certain noisy query learning problems are a special case of our problem. Crucial to our analysis is a lemma showing the logical OR of two submodular cover constraints can be reduced to a single submodular set cover constraint.  Combined with known results, this new lemma allows for arbitrary monotone circuits of submodular cover constraints to be reduced to a single constraint.  As an example practical application, we present a movie recommendation website that minimizes the total cost of learning what the user wants to watch and recommending a set of movies. </p>

<span class='name'>Ankit Kuwadekar, Jennifer  Neville</span>
<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>In many network domains, labeled data may be costly to acquire---indicating a need for {\em relational active learning} methods. Recent work has demonstrated that relational model performance can be improved by taking network structure into account when choosing instances to label. However, in collective inference settings, {\em both} model estimation {\em and} prediction can be improved by acquiring a node's label---since relational models estimate a joint distribution over labels in the network and collective classification methods propagate information from labeled training data during prediction. This conflates improvement in learning with improvement in inference, since labeling nodes can reduce inference error without improving the overall quality of the learned model. Here, we use {\em across-network} classification to separate the effects on learning and prediction, and focus on reduction of learning error. When label propagation is used for learning, we find that labeling based on prediction {\em certainty} is more effective than labeling based on {\em uncertainty}. As such, we propose a novel active learning method that combines a network-based {\em certainty} metric with semi-supervised learning and relational resampling. We evaluate our approach on synthetic and real-world networks and show faster learning compared to several baselines, including the network based method of Bilgic et al. 2010. </p>

Hence, we constrain our approach to only search for the clusterings that agree across the views.

<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>We address the problem of metric learning for multi-view data, namely the construction of embedding projections from data in different representations into a shared feature space, such that the Euclidean distance in this space provides a meaningful within-view as well as between-view similarity. Our motivation stems from the problem of cross-media retrieval tasks, where the availability of a joint Euclidean distance function is a prerequisite to allow fast, in particular hashing-based, nearest neighbor queries. We formulate an objective function that expresses the intuitive concept that matching samples are mapped closely together in the output space, whereas non-matching samples are pushed apart, no matter in which view they are available. The resulting optimization problem is not convex, but it can be decomposed explicitly into a convex and a concave part, thereby allowing efficient optimization using the convex-concave procedure. Experiments on an image retrieval task show that nearest-neighbor based cross-view retrieval is indeed possible, and the proposed technique improves the retrieval accuracy over baseline techniques.  </p>

<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>Learning complex skills by repeating and generalizing expert behavior is a fundamental problem in robotics. A common approach is learning from demonstration: given examples of correct motions, learn a policy mapping state to action consistent with the training data. However, the usual approaches do not answer the question of what are appropriate representations to generate motions for specific tasks. Inspired by Inverse Optimal Control, we present a novel method to learn latent costs, imitate and generalize demonstrated behavior, and discover a task relevant motion representation: Task Space Retrieval Using Inverse Feedback Control (TRIC). We use the learned latent costs to create motion with a feedback controller. We tested our method on robot grasping of objects, a challenging high-dimensional task.  TRIC learns the important control dimensions for the grasping task from a few example movements and is able to robustly approach and grasp objects in new situations. </p>

<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>Bayesian treatments of Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) -type latent variable models have been recently proposed for coping with overfitting in small sample sizes, as well as for producing factorizations of the data sources into correlated and non-shared effects. However, all of the current implementations of Bayesian CCA and its extensions are computationally inefficient for high-dimensional data and, as shown in this paper, break down completely for high-dimensional sources with low sample count. Furthermore, they cannot reliably separate the correlated effects from non-shared ones. We propose a new Bayesian CCA variant that is computationally efficient and works for high-dimensional data, while also learning the factorization more accurately. The improvements are gained by introducing a group sparsity assumption and an improved variational approximation. The method is demonstrated to work well on multi-label prediction tasks and in analyzing brain correlates of naturalistic audio stimulation. </p>

<span class='name'>Marc Deisenroth, Carl Rasmussen</span>
<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>In this paper, we introduce PILCO, a practical, data-efficient model-based policy search method. PILCO reduces model bias, one of the key problems of model-based  reinforcement learning, in a principled way. By learning a   probabilistic dynamics model and explicitly incorporating model   uncertainty into long-term planning, PILCO can cope with   very little data and facilitates learning from scratch in only a few   trials. Policy evaluation is performed in closed form using   state-of-the-art approximate inference. Furthermore, policy   gradients are computed analytically for policy improvement. We report unprecedented learning efficiency on challenging and   high-dimensional control tasks. </p>

<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>We consider a suboptimal solution path algorithm for the Support Vector Machine. The solution path algorithm is known as an effective tool for solving a sequence of a parametrized optimization problems in machine learning. However, the algorithm needs to keep strict optimality conditions satisfied everywhere on the path. This requirement narrows the applicability of the path algorithm and adversely affects its computational efficiency. In our algorithm, user can specify tolerances to the optimality and control the trade-off between accuracy of the solution and the computational cost. We also show that our suboptimal solutions can be interpreted as the solution of a perturbed optimization problem from the original one, provide some theoretical analyses of our algorithm based on a novel interpretation. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in terms of efficiency and accuracy. </p>

<span class='name'>Yi Sun, Faustino Gomez, Mark Ring, J�rgen Schmidhuber</span>
<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>In many reinforcement-learning (RL) systems, the value function is approximated as a linear combination of a fixed set of basis functions. Performance can be improved by adding to this set. Previous approaches construct a series of basis functions that in sufficient number can eventually represent the value function. In contrast, we show that there is a single, ideal basis function, which can directly represent the value function. Its addition to the set immediately reduces the error to zero---without changing existing weights. Moreover, this ideal basis function is simply the value function that results from replacing the MDP's reward function with its Bellman error. This result suggests a novel method for improving value-function estimation: a primary reinforcement learner estimates its value function using its present basis functions; it then sends its TD error to a secondary learner, which interprets that error as a reward function and estimates the corresponding value function; the resulting value function then becomes the primary learner's new basis function. We present both batch and online versions in combination with incremental basis projection, and demonstrate that the performance is superior to existing methods, especially in the case of large discount factors. </p>

<span class='name'>Shinichi Nakajima, Masashi Sugiyama, Derin Babacan</span>
<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>In probabilistic PCA, the fully Bayesian estimation is computationally intractable. To cope with this problem, two types of approximation schemes were introduced: the partially Bayesian PCA (PB-PCA) where only the latent variables are integrated out, and the variational Bayesian PCA (VB-PCA) where the loading vectors are also integrated out. The VB-PCA was proposed as an improved variant of PB-PCA for enabling automatic dimensionality selection (ADS). In this paper, we investigate whether VB-PCA is really the best choice from the viewpoints of computational efficiency and ADS. We first show that ADS is not the unique feature of VB-PCA---PB-PCA is also actually equipped with ADS. We further show that PB-PCA is more advantageous in computational efficiency than VB-PCA because the global solution of PB-PCA can be computed analytically. However, we also show the negative fact that PB-PCA results in a trivial solution in the empirical Bayesian framework. We next consider a simplified variant of VB-PCA, where the latent variables and loading vectors are assumed to be mutually independent (while the ordinary VB-PCA only requires matrix-wise independence). We show that this simplified VB-PCA is the most advantageous in practice because its empirical Bayes solution experimentally works as well as the original VB-PCA, and its global optimal solution can be computed efficiently in a closed form.  </p>

<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>We analyze variations of multiplicative updates for learning linear functions online.  These can be described as substituting exponentiation in the Exponentiated Gradient (EG) algorithm with quadratic and linear functions.  Both kinds of updates substitute exponentiation with simpler operations and reduce dependence on the parameter that specifies the sum of the weights during learning.  In particular, the linear multiplicative update places no restrictions on the sum of the weights, and, under a wide range of conditions, achieves worst-case behavior close to the EG algorithm.  We perform our analysis for square loss and absolute loss, and for regression and classification.  We also describe some experiments showing that the performance of our algorithms are comparable to EG and the $p$-norm algorithm.  </p>

<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>The exponential increase in the availability of online reviews and recommendations makes sentiment classification an interesting topic in academic and industrial research.  Reviews can span so many different domains that it is difficult to gather annotated training data for all of them.  Hence, this paper studies the problem of domain adaptation for sentiment classifiers, hereby a system is trained on labeled reviews from one source domain but is meant to be deployed on another.  We propose a deep learning approach which learns to extract a meaningful representation for each review in an unsupervised fashion.  Sentiment classifiers trained with this high-level feature representation clearly outperform state-of-the-art methods on a benchmark composed of reviews of 4 types of Amazon products.  Furthermore, this method scales well and allowed us to successfully perform domain adaptation on a larger industrial-strength dataset of 22 domains. </p>

<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>In multi-task learning (MTL), multiple tasks are learnt jointly. A major assumption for this paradigm is that all those tasks are indeed related so that the joint training is appropriate and beneficial. In this paper, we study the problem of multi-task learning of shared feature representations among tasks, while simultaneously determining ``with whom'' each task should share. We formulate the problem as a mixed integer programming and provide an alternating minimization technique to solve the optimization problem of jointly identifying grouping structures and parameters. The algorithm monotonically decreases the objective function and converges to a local optimum. Compared to the standard MTL paradigm where all tasks are in a single group, our algorithm improves its performance   with statistical significance for three out of the four datasets we have studied. We also demonstrate its advantage over other task grouping techniques investigated in literature. </p>

<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>Data streams are ubiquitous and have in the last two decades become an important research topic. For their predictive non-parametric analysis, Hoeffding-based trees are often a method of choice, offering a possibility of any-time predictions. However, one of their main problems is the delay in learning progress due to the existence of equally discriminative attributes. Options are a natural way to deal with this problem. Option trees build upon regular trees by adding splitting options in the internal nodes. As such they are known to improve accuracy, stability and reduce ambiguity. In this paper, we present on-line option trees for faster learning on numerical data streams. Our results show that options improve the any-time performance of ordinary on-line regression trees, while preserving the interpretable structure of trees and without significantly increasing the computational complexity of the algorithm. </p>

<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>Laplacian embedding provides a low-dimensional representation for the nodes of a graph where the edge weights denote pairwise similarity among the node objects. It is commonly assumed that the Laplacian embedding results preserve the local topology of the original data on the low-dimensional projected subspaces, i.e., for any pair of graph nodes with large similarity, they should be embedded closely in the embedded space. However, in this paper, we will show that the Laplacian embedding often cannot preserve local topology well as we expected. To enhance the local topology preserving property in graph embedding, we propose a novel Cauchy graph embedding which preserves the similarity relationships of the original data in the embedded space via a new objective. Consequentially the machine learning tasks (such as k Nearest Neighbor type classifications) can be easily conducted on the embedded data with better performance. The experimental results on both synthetic and real world benchmark data sets demonstrate the usefulness of this new type of embedding. </p>

<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>Time plays an essential role in the diffusion of information, influence and disease over networks. In many cases we only observe when a node copies information, makes a decision or becomes infected -- but the connectivity, transmission rates between nodes and transmission sources are unknown. Inferring the underlying dynamics is of outstanding interest since it enables forecasting, influencing and retarding infections, broadly construed. To this end, we model diffusion processes as discrete networks of continuous temporal processes occurring at different rates. Given cascade data -- observed infection times of nodes -- we infer the edges of the global diffusion network and estimate the transmission rates of each edge that best explain the observed data. The optimization problem is convex. The model naturally (without heuristics) imposes sparse solutions and requires no parameter tuning. The problem decouples into a collection of independent smaller problems, thus scaling easily to networks on the order of hundreds of thousands of nodes. Experiments on real and synthetic data show that our algorithm both recovers the edges of diffusion networks and accurately estimates their transmission rates from cascade data. </p>

<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>Multiclass classification is an important and fundamental problem in machine learning. A popular family of multiclass classification methods belongs to reducing multiclass to binary based on output coding. Several multiclass boosting algorithms have been proposed to learn the coding matrix and the associated binary classifiers in a problem-dependent way. These algorithms can be unified under a sum-of-exponential loss function defined in the domain of margins. Instead, multiclass SVM uses another type of loss function based on hinge loss. In this paper, we present a new output-coding-based multiclass boosting algorithm using the multiclass hinge loss, which we call HingeBoost.OC. HingeBoost.OC is tested on various real world datasets and shows better performance than the existing multiclass boosting algorithm AdaBoost.ERP, one-vs-one, one-vs-all, ECOC and multiclass SVM in a majority of different cases. </p>

<span class='name'>Jose Hernandez-Orallo, Peter Flach, C�sar Ferri</span>
<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>It is often necessary to evaluate classifier performance over a range of operating conditions, rather than as a point estimate. This is typically assessed through the construction of �curves�over a �space�, visualising how one or two performance metrics vary with the operating condition.  For binary classifiers in particular, cost space is a natural way of showing this range of performance, visualising loss against operating condition. However, the curves which have been traditionally drawn in cost space, known as cost curves, show the optimal loss, and hence assume knowledge of the optimal decision threshold for a given operating condition. Clearly, this leads to an optimistic assessment of classifier performance. In this paper we propose a more natural way of visualising classifier performance in cost space, which is to plot probabilistic loss on the y-axis, i.e., the loss arising from the probability estimates. This new curve provides new ways of understanding classifier performance and new tools to compare classifiers. In addition, we show that the area under this curve is exactly the Brier score, one of the most popular performance metrics for probabilistic classifiers. </p>

We describe a framework for approximately computing minimax optimal piecewise quadratic bounds, as well a generalized expectation maximization algorithm based on using piecewise bounds to estimate bLGMs. We prove a theoretical result relating the maximum error in the LLP bound to the maximum error in the marginal likelihood estimate.

<span class='name'>Ruth Urner, Shai Shalev-Shwartz, Shai Ben-David</span>
<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>Semi-supervised learning (SSL) addresses the problem of training a classifier using a small number of labeled examples and many unlabeled examples. Most previous work on SSL focused on how availability of unlabeled data can improve the accuracy of the learned classifiers. In this work we study how unlabeled data can be beneficial for constructing faster classifiers. We propose an SSL algorithmic framework which can utilize unlabeled examples for learning classifiers from a predefined set of fast classifiers. We formally analyze conditions under which our algorithmic paradigm obtains significant improvements by the use of unlabeled data. As a side benefit of our analysis we propose a novel quantitative measure of the so-called cluster assumption. We demonstrate the potential merits of our approach by conducting experiments on the MNIST data set, showing that, when a sufficiently large  unlabeled sample is available,  a fast classifier can be learned from much fewer labeled examples than without such a sample.  </p>

<span class='name'>Jean-Francis Roy, Francois Laviolette, Mario Marchand</span>
<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>We propose to construct a weighted majority vote on a set of basis functions by minimizing a risk bound (called the C-bound) that depends on the first two moments of the margin of the Q-convex combination realized on the training data. This bound minimization algorithm turns out to be a quadratic program that can be efficiently solved. A first version of the algorithm is designed for the supervised inductive setting and turns out to be competitive with AdaBoost, MDBoost and the SVM. The second version of the algorithm, designed for the transductive setting, competes well with TSVM. We also propose a new PAC-Bayes theorem that bounds the difference between the "true" value of the C-bound and its empirical estimate and that, unexpectedly, contains no KL-divergence. </p>

<span class='name'>Peter Flach, Jose Hernandez-Orallo, C�sar Ferri</span>
<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>The area under the ROC curve (AUC), a well-known measure of ranking performance, is also often used as a measure of classification performance, aggregating over decision thresholds as well as class and cost skews. However, David Hand has recently argued that AUC is fundamentally incoherent as a measure of aggregated classifier performance and proposed an alternative measure. Specifically, Hand derives a linear relationship between AUC and expected minimum loss, where the expectation is taken over a distribution of the misclassification cost parameter that depends on the model under consideration. Replacing this distribution with a Beta(2;2) distribution, Hand derives his alternative measure H. In this paper we offer an alternative, coherent interpretation of AUC as linearly related to expected loss. We use a distribution over cost parameter and a distribution over data points, both uniform and hence model independent. Should one wish to consider only optimal thresholds, we demonstrate that a simple and more intuitive alternative to Hand�s H measure is already available in the form of the area under the cost curve. </p>

<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>We introduce an algorithm that, given n objects, learns a similarity matrix over all n^2 pairs, from crowdsourced data *alone*. The algorithm samples responses to adaptively chosen triplet-based relative-similarity queries.

The output is an embedding of the objects into Euclidean space (like MDS); we refer to this as the "crowd kernel."

<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>In this paper we propose a new framework for learning from large scale datasets based on iterative learning from small mini-batches.   By adding the right amount of noise to a standard stochastic gradient optimization algorithm we show that the iterates will converge to samples from the true posterior distribution as we anneal the stepsize. This seamless transition between optimization and Bayesian posterior sampling provides an in-built protection against overfitting.   We also propose a practical method for Monte Carlo estimates of posterior statistics which monitors a ``sampling threshold'' and collects samples after it has been surpassed.   We apply the method to three models: a mixture of Gaussians, logistic regression and ICA with natural gradients.    </p>

<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>Deep networks have been successfully applied to unsupervised feature learning for single modalities (e.g., text, images or audio). In this work, we propose a novel application of deep networks to learn features over multiple modalities. We present a series of tasks for multimodal learning and show how to train deep networks that learn features to address these tasks. In particular, we demonstrate cross modality feature learning, where better features for one modality (e.g., video) can be learned if multiple modalities (e.g., audio and video) are present at feature learning time. Furthermore, we show how to learn a shared representation between modalities and evaluate it on a unique task, where the classifier is trained with audio-only data but tested with video-only data and vice-versa. Our methods are validated on the CUAVE and AVLetters datasets with an audio-visual speech classification task, demonstrating best published visual speech classification on AVLetters and effective shared representation learning. </p>

<span class='name'>JooSeuk Kim, Clayton Scott</span>
<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>We analyze a method for nonparametric density estimation that exhibits robustness to contamination of the training sample. This method achieves robustness by combining a traditional kernel density estimator (KDE) with ideas from classical M-estimation. The KDE based on a Gaussian kernel is interpreted as a sample mean in the associated reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). This mean is estimated robustly through the use of a robust loss, yielding the so-called robust kernel density estimator (RKDE). This robust sample mean can be found via a kernelized iteratively re-weighted least squares (IRWLS) algorithm. Our contributions are summarized as follows. First, we present a representer theorem for the RKDE, which gives an insight into the robustness of the RKDE. Second, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for kernel IRWLS to converge to the global minimizer, in the Gaussian RKHS, of the objective function defining the RKDE. Third, characterize and provide a method for computing the influence function associated with the RKDE. Fourth, we illustrate the robustness of the RKDE through experiments on several data sets. </p>

<span class='name'>Piyush Rai, Hal Daume III, University of Maryland</span>
<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>Nonparametric latent feature models offer a flexible way to discover the latent features underlying the data, without having to a priori specify their number. The Indian Buffet Process (IBP) is a popular example of such a model. Inference in IBP based models, however, remains a challenge. Sampling techniques such as MCMC can be computationally expensive and can take a long time to converge to the stationary distribution. Variational techniques, although faster than sampling, can be difficult to design, and can still remain slow on large data. In many problems, however, we only seek a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the latent feature assignment matrix. For such cases, we show that techniques such as beam search can give fast, approximate MAP estimates in the IBP based models. If samples from the posterior are desired, these MAP estimates can also serve as sensible initializers for MCMC based algorithms. Experimental results on a variety of datasets suggest that our algorithms can be a computationally viable alternative to Gibbs sampling, the particle filter, and variational inference based approaches for the IBP, and also perform better than other heuristics such as greedy search. </p>

In this paper, we present the distributed mini-batch (DMB) framework, a method of converting a serial gradient-based online algorithm into a distributed algorithm, and prove an asymptotically optimal regret bound for smooth convex loss functions and stochastic examples. Our analysis explicitly takes into account communication latencies between computing nodes in a network. We also present robust variants, which are resilient to failures and node heterogeneity in an synchronous distributed environment. Our method can also be used for distributed stochastic optimization, attaining an asymptotically linear speedup. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the merits of our approach on large-scale online prediction problems. </p>

Although DDTs provide a powerful and elegant approach for modeling hierarchies they haven't seen much use to date. One problem is the computational cost of MCMC inference. We provide the first deterministic approximate inference methods for DDT models and show excellent performance compared to the MCMC alternative. We present message passing algorithms to approximate the Bayesian model evidence for a specific tree. This is used to drive sequential tree building and greedy search to find optimal tree structures, corresponding to hierarchical clusterings of the data. We demonstrate appropriate observation models for continuous and binary data. The empirical performance of our method is very close to the computationally expensive MCMC alternative on a density estimation problem, and significantly outperforms kernel density estimators.  </p>

While this approach provides the theoretical guarantees it is not very practical.

The goal of visualization is to embed high dimensional data in a low dimensional space, while preserving structure in the data relevant to exploratory data analysis, such as the existence of clusters. However, existing visualization methods often either entirely fail to preserve clusters in embeddings due to the crowding problem or can only preserve clusters at a single resolution. Here, we develop a new approach to visualization, tree preserving embedding (TPE). Our approach takes advantage of the topological notion of connectedness to provably preserve clusters at all resolutions. Our performance guarantee holds for finite samples, which makes TPE a robust method for applications. Our approach suggests new strategies for robust data visualization in practice. </p>

<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>Choosing a subgraph that can concisely represent a large real-world graph is useful in many scenarios. The usual strategy employed is to sample nodes so that the induced subgraph matches the original graph�s degree distribution, clustering coefficient, etc., but no attempt is made to preserve fine-grained relationships between nodes, which are vital for applications like clustering, classification, and ranking. In this work, we model such relationships via the notion of Personalized PageRank Value (PPV). We show that induced subgraphs output by current sampling methods do not preserve PPVs, and propose algorithms for creating PPV-preserving subgraphs on any given subset of graph nodes. Experiments on three large real-world graphs show that the subgraphs created by our method improve upon induced subgraphs in terms of preserving PPVs, clustering accuracy, and maintaining basic graph properties. </p>

More specifically, we introduce regularizations that force the normal vector of the classifying hyperplane at each node to be orthogonal to those at its ancestors as much as possible.

However, the KL-divergence is not symmetric and we can also minimize the the reversed KL-divergence, which is typically used in variational inference.  The policy now becomes 'cost-averse'. It tries to avoid reproducing any negatively-rewarded experience while maximizing exploration.   Due to this 'cost-averseness' of the policy, Variational Inference for Policy Search (VIP) has several interesting properties. It requires no kernel-bandwith nor exploration rate, such settings are determined automatically by the inference. The algorithm meets the performance of state-of-the-art methods while being applicable to simultaneously learning in multiple situations.  We concentrate on using VIP for policy search in robotics. We apply our algorithm to learn dynamic counterbalancing of different kinds of pushes with a human-like 4-link robot.  </p>

<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>We address the problem of designing surrogate losses for learning scoring functions in the context of label ranking. We extend to ranking problems a notion of order preserving losses previously introduced for multiclass classi?cation, and show that these losses lead to consistent formulations with respect to a family of ranking evaluation metrics. An order-preserving loss can be tailored for a given evaluation metric by appropriately setting some weights depending on this metric and the observed supervision. These weights, called the standard form of the supervision, do not always exist, but we show that previous consistency results for ranking were proved in special cases where they do. We then evaluate a new pairwise loss consistent with the (Normalized) Discounted Cumulative Gain on benchmark datasets. </p>

<span class='name'>Salah RIFAI, Pascal Vincent, Xavier Muller, Xavier Glorot, Yoshua Bengio</span>
<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>We present in this paper a novel approach for training deterministic auto-encoders. We show that by adding a well chosen penalty term to the classical reconstruction cost function, we can achieve results that equal or surpass those attained by other regularized auto-encoders as well as denoising auto-encoders on a range of datasets. This penalty term corresponds to the Frobenius norm of the Jacobian matrix of the encoder activations with respect to the input.  We show that this penalty term results in a localized space contraction which in turn yields robust features on the activation layer.  Furthermore, we show how this penalty term is related to both regularized auto-encoders and denoising auto-encoders and how it can be seen as a link between deterministic and non-deterministic auto-encoders. We find empirically that this penalty helps to carve a representation that better captures the local directions of variation dictated by the data, corresponding to a lower-dimensional non-linear manifold, while being more invariant to the vast majority of directions orthogonal to the manifold. Finally, we show that by using the learned features to initialize an MLP, we achieve state of the art classification error on a range of datasets, surpassing other methods of pre-training. </p>

This is often a too restrictive assumption, but one that is needed for GP inference to be tractable. In this work we present a non-standard variational approximation that allows accurate inference in heteroscedastic GPs (i.e., under input-dependent noise conditions). Computational cost is roughly twice that of the standard GP, and also scales as O(n^3). Accuracy is verified by comparing with the golden standard MCMC and its effectiveness is illustrated on several synthetic and real datasets of diverse characteristics. An application to volatility forecasting is also considered. </p>

In this paper, we introduce a dynamic egocentric framework that models continuous-time network data using multivariate counting processes.

<span class='name'>Kevin Small, Byron Wallace, Carla Brodley, Thomas Trikalinos</span>
<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>Applying supervised learning methods to new classification tasks requires domain experts to label sufficient training data for the classifier to achieve acceptable performance. It is desirable to mitigate this annotation effort. To this end, a pertinent observation is that instance labels are often an indirect form of supervision; it may be more efficient to impart domain knowledge directly to the model in the form of labeled features. We present a novel algorithm for exploiting such domain knowledge which we call the Constrained Weight Space SVM (CW-SVM). In addition to exploiting binary labeled features, our approach allows domain experts to provide ranked features, and, more generally, to express arbitrary expected relationships between sets of features. Our empirical results show that the CW-SVM outperforms both baseline supervised learning strategies and previously proposed methods for learning with labeled features.  </p>

<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>Online representational expansion techniques have improved the learning speed of existing reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in low dimensional domains, yet existing online expansion methods do not scale well to high dimensional problems. We conjecture that one of the main difficulties limiting this scaling is that features defined over the full-dimensional state space often generalize poorly. Hence, we introduce incremental Feature Dependency Discovery (iFDD) as a computationally-inexpensive method for representational expansion that can be combined with any online, value-based RL method that uses binary features. Unlike other online expansion techniques, iFDD creates new features in low dimensional subspaces of the full state space where feedback errors persist. We provide convergence and computational complexity guarantees for iFDD, as well as showing empirically that iFDD scales well to high dimensional multi-agent planning domains with hundreds of millions of state-action pairs. </p>

<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>Fitting probabilistic models to data is often difficult, due to the general intractability of the partition function and its derivatives. Here we propose a new parameter estimation technique that does not require computing an intractable normalization factor or sampling from the equilibrium distribution of the model.  This is achieved by establishing dynamics that would transform the observed data distribution into the model distribution, and then setting as the objective the minimization of the KL divergence between the data distribution and the distribution produced by running the dynamics for an infinitesimal time. Score matching, minimum velocity learning, and certain forms of contrastive divergence are shown to be special cases of this learning technique. We demonstrate parameter estimation in Ising models, deep belief networks and an independent component analysis model of natural scenes.  In the Ising model case, current state of the art techniques are outperformed by at least an order of magnitude in learning time, with lower error in recovered coupling parameters. </p>

<span class='name'>Adam Coates, Andrew  Ng</span>
<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>  While vector quantization (VQ) has been applied widely to generate features for visual recognition problems, much recent work has focused on more powerful methods.  In particular, sparse coding has emerged as a strong alternative to traditional VQ approaches and has been shown to achieve consistently higher performance on benchmark datasets.  Both approaches can be split into a training phase, where the system learns a dictionary of basis functions from unlabeled data, and an encoding phase, where the dictionary is used to extract features from new inputs.  In this work, we investigate the reasons for the success of sparse coding over VQ by decoupling these phases, allowing us to separate out the contributions of the training and encoding in a controlled way.  Through extensive experiments on CIFAR, NORB and Caltech 101 datasets, we compare sparse coding and several other training and encoding schemes, including a form of VQ paired with a soft threshold activation function.  Our results show not only that we can use fast VQ algorithms for training without penalty, but that we can just as well use randomly chosen exemplars from the training set.  Rather than spend resources on training, we find it is more important to choose a good encoder---which can often be as simple as a feed forward non-linearity.  Among our results, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on both CIFAR and NORB.  </p>

Motivated by theories of the human perceptual system, the model consists of two interacting pathways: ventral and dorsal. The ventral pathway models object appearance and classification using deep (factored)-restricted Boltzmann machines. At each point in time, the observations consist of retinal images, with decaying resolution toward the periphery of the gaze. The dorsal pathway models the location, orientation, scale and speed of the attended object. The posterior distribution of these states is estimated with particle filtering. Deeper in the dorsal pathway, we encounter an attentional mechanism that learns to control gazes so as to minimize tracking uncertainty. The approach is modular (with each module easily replaceable with more sophisticated algorithms), straightforward to implement, practically efficient, and works well in simple video sequences. </p>

Our speed-up method has been developed in the context of Denoising Auto-encoders, which are trained in a purely unsupervised way to capture the input distribution, and learn embeddings for words and text similar to earlier neural language models. The main contribution is a new method to approximate reconstruction error by a sampling procedure.  We show how this approximation can be made to obtain an unbiased estimator of the training criterion, and we show how it can be leveraged to make learning much more computationally efficient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on the Amazon and RCV1 NLP datasets. Instead of reducing vocabulary size to make learning practical, our method allows us to train using very large vocabularies. In particular, reconstruction sampling requires 22x less training time on the full Amazon dataset. </p>

In this paper, we extend co-training  to learning scenarios without an explicit multi-view representation. Inspired by a theoretical analysis of Balcan et. al (2004), we introduce a novel algorithm that splits the feature space during learning, explicitly to encourage co-training to be successful.

It is known that the unconstrained submodular minimization problem can be solved in strongly polynomial time. However, additional constraints make the problem intractable in many settings. In this paper, we discuss the submodular minimization under a size constraint, which is NP-hard, and generalizes the densest subgraph problem and the uniform graph partitioning problem. Because of NP-hardness, it is difficult to compute an optimal solution even for a prescribed size constraint. In our approach, we do not give approximation algorithms. Instead, the proposed algorithm computes optimal solutions for some of possible size constraints in polynomial time. Our algorithm utilizes the basic polyhedral theory associated with submodular functions. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm through computational experiments.  </p>

<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>Linear support vector machines ({\sc svm}s) have become popular for solving classification tasks due to their fast and simple online application to large scale data sets. However, many problems are not linearly separable. For these problems kernel-based {\sc svm}s are often used, but unlike their linear variant they suffer from various drawbacks in terms of computational and memory efficiency. Their response can be represented only as a function of the set of support vectors, which has been experimentally shown to grow linearly with the size of the training set. In this paper we propose a novel locally linear {\sc svm} classifier with smooth decision boundary and bounded curvature. We show how the functions defining the classifier can be approximated using local codings and show how this model can be optimized in an online fashion by performing stochastic gradient descent with the same convergence guarantees as standard gradient descent method for linear {\sc svm}. Our method achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art whilst being significantly faster than competing kernel {\sc svm}s.

<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>Although operator-valued kernels have recently received increasing interest in various machine learning and functional data analysis problems such as multi-task learning or functional regression, little attention has been paid to the understanding of their associated feature spaces. In this paper, we explore the potential of adopting an operator-valued kernel feature space perspective for the analysis of functional data. We then extend the Regularized Least Squares Classification (RLSC) algorithm to cover situations where there are multiple functions per observation. Experiments on a sound recognition problem show that the proposed method outperforms the classical RLSC algorithm. </p>

<span class='name'>Ali Jalali, Yudong Chen, Sujay Sanghavi, Huan Xu</span>
<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>This paper considers the problem of clustering a partially observed unweighted graph -- i.e. one where for some node pairs we know there is an edge between them, for some others we know there is no edge, and for the remaining we do not know whether or not there is an edge. We want to organize the nodes into disjoint clusters so that there is relatively dense (observed) connectivity within clusters, and sparse across clusters.  We take a novel yet natural approach to this problem, by focusing on finding the clustering that minimizes the number of "disagreements" - i.e. the sum of the number of (observed) missing edges within clusters, and (observed) present edges across clusters. Our algorithm uses convex optimization; its basis is a reduction of disagreement minimization to the problem of recovering an (unknown) low-rank matrix and an (unknown) sparse matrix from their partially observed sum. We show that our algorithm succeeds under certain natural assumptions on the optimal clustering and its disagreements. Our results significantly strengthen existing matrix splitting results for the special case of our clustering problem. Our results directly enhance solutions to the problem of Correlation Clustering with partial observations </p>

<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>We study the general class of estimators for graphical model structure based on optimizing $\ell_1$-regularized approximate log-likelihood, where the approximate likelihood uses tractable variational approximations of the partition function. We provide a message-passing algorithm that \emph{directly} computes the $\ell_1$ regularized approximate MLE. Further, in the case of certain reweighted entropy approximations to the partition function, we show that surprisingly the $\ell_1$ regularized approximate MLE estimator has a \emph{closed-form}, so that we would no longer need to run through many iterations of approximate inference and message-passing. Lastly, we analyze this general class of estimators for graph structure recovery, or its \emph{sparsistency}, and show that it is indeed sparsistent under certain conditions.  </p>

<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are very powerful sequence models that do not enjoy widespread use because it is extremely difficult to train them properly.  Fortunately, recent advances in Hessian-free optimization have been able to overcome the difficulties associated with training RNNs, making it possible to apply them successfully to challenging sequence problems.  In this paper we demonstrate the power of RNNs trained with the new Hessian-Free optimizer (HF) by applying them to character-level language modeling tasks.  The standard RNN architecture, while effective, is not ideally suited for such tasks, so we introduce a new RNN variant that uses multiplicative (or ``gated'') connections which allow the current input character to determine the transition matrix from one hidden state vector to the next. After training the multiplicative RNN with the HF optimizer for five days on 8 high-end Graphics Processing Units, we were able to surpass the performance of the best previous single method for character-level language modeling -- a hierarchical non-parametric sequence model.  To our knowledge this represents the largest recurrent neural network application to date. </p>

<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>We introduce Probabilistic Matrix Addition (PMA) for modeling real-valued data matrices by  simultaneously capturing covariance structure among rows and among columns. PMA additively combines two latent matrices drawn from two Gaussian Processes respectively over rows and columns. The resulting joint distribution over the observed matrix does not factorize over entries, rows, or columns, and can thus capture intricate dependencies in the matrix. Exact inference in PMA is possible, but involves inversion of large matrices, and can be computationally prohibitive. Efficient approximate inference is possible due to the sparse dependency structure among latent variables. We propose two families of approximate inference algorithms for PMA based on Gibbs sampling and MAP inference. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PMA for missing value prediction and multi-label classification problems. </p>

Utilizing recent advances in the Hessian-free optimization approach \citep{hf}, together with a novel damping scheme, we successfully train RNNs on two sets of challenging problems.  First, a collection of pathological synthetic datasets which are known to be impossible for standard optimization approaches (due to their extremely long-term dependencies), and second, on three natural and highly complex real-world sequence datasets where we find that our method significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method for training neural sequence models: the Long Short-term Memory approach of \citet{lstm}.  Additionally, we offer a new interpretation of the generalized Gauss-Newton matrix of \citet{schraudolph} which is used within the HF approach of Martens. </p>

<span class='name'>Jacob Eisenstein, Amr Ahmed, Eric  Xing</span>
<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>Generative models of text typically associate a multinomial with every class label or topic.  Even in simple models this requires the estimation of thousands of parameters; in multifaceted latent variable models, standard approaches require additional latent ``switching'' variables for every token, complicating inference.  In this paper, we propose an alternative generative model for text. The central idea is that each class label or latent topic is endowed with a model of the deviation in log-frequency from a constant background distribution.  This approach has two key advantages: we can enforce sparsity to prevent overfitting, and we can combine generative facets through simple addition in log space, avoiding the need for latent switching variables.  We demonstrate the applicability of this idea to a range of scenarios: classification, topic modeling, and more complex multifaceted generative models. </p>

<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>In this paper, we study the effect of adding a value function approximation component (critic) to rollout classification-based policy iteration (RCPI) algorithms. The idea is to use a critic to approximate the return after we truncate the rollout trajectories. This allows us to control the bias and variance of the rollout estimates of the action-value function. Therefore, the introduction of a critic can improve the accuracy of the rollout estimates, and as a result, enhance the performance of the RCPI algorithm. We present a new RCPI algorithm, called direct policy iteration with critic (DPI-Critic), and provide its finite-sample analysis when the critic is based on the LSTD method. We empirically evaluate the performance of DPI-Critic and compare it with DPI and LSPI in two benchmark reinforcement learning problems. </p>

This problem can be viewed in the context of both feature selection and sparse approximation. We analyze the performance of widely used greedy heuristics, using insights from the maximization of submodular functions and spectral analysis. We introduce the submodularity ratio as a key quantity to help understand why greedy algorithms perform well even when the variables are highly correlated. Using our techniques, we obtain the strongest known approximation guarantees for this problem, both in terms of the submodularity ratio and the smallest $k$-sparse eigenvalue of the covariance matrix. We also  analyze greedy algorithms for the dictionary selection problem, and significantly improve the previously known guarantees. Our theoretical analysis is complemented by experiments on real-world and synthetic data sets; the experiments show that the submodular ratio is a stronger predictor of the performance of greedy algorithms than other spectral parameters.  </p>

<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>Existing algorithms for joint clustering and feature selection can be categorized as either global or local approaches.  Global methods select a single cluster-independent subset of features, whereas local methods select cluster-specific subsets of features.  In this paper, we present a unified probabilistic model that can perform both global and local feature selection for clustering.  Our approach is based on a hierarchical beta-Bernoulli prior combined with a Dirichlet process mixture model.  We obtain global or local feature selection by adjusting the variance of the beta prior.  We provide a variational inference algorithm for our model. In addition to simultaneously learning the clusters and features, this Bayesian formulation allows us to learn both the number of clusters and the number of features to retain.  Experiments on synthetic and real data show that our unified model can find global and local features and cluster data as well as competing methods of each type. </p>

<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>It is usually expected that, when labeled data are limited, the learning performance can be improved by exploiting unlabeled data. In many cases, however, the performances of current semi-supervised learning approaches may be even worse than purely using the limited labeled data.It is desired to have \textit{safe} semi-supervised learning approaches which never degenerate learning performance by using unlabeled data. In this paper, we focus on semi-supervised support vector machines (S3VMs) and propose S4VMs, i.e., safe S3VMs. Unlike S3VMs which typically aim at approaching an optimal low-density separator, S4VMs try to exploit the candidate low-density separators simultaneously to reduce the risk of identifying a poor separator with unlabeled data. We describe two implementations of S4VMs, and our comprehensive experiments show that the overall performance of S4VMs are highly competitive to S3VMs, while in contrast to S3VMs which degenerate performance in many cases, S4VMs are never significantly inferior to inductive SVMs. </p>

<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>Recently two anomalous results in the literature have shown that certain feature learning architectures can yield useful features for object recognition tasks even with untrained, random weights. In this paper we pose the question: why do random weights sometimes do so well? Our answer is that certain convolutional pooling architectures can be inherently frequency selective and translation invariant, even with random weights. Based on this we demonstrate the viability of extremely fast architecture search by using random weights to evaluate candidate architectures, thereby sidestepping the time-consuming learning process. We then show that a surprising fraction of the performance of certain state-of-the-art methods can be attributed to the architecture alone. </p>

<span class='name'>Miroslav Dudik, John  Langford, Lihong Li</span>
<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>  We study decision making in environments where the reward is only   partially observed, but can be modeled as a function of an action   and an observed context. This setting, known as contextual bandits,   encompasses a wide variety of applications including health-care   policy and Internet advertising. A central task is evaluation of a new   policy given historic data consisting of contexts, actions and   received rewards. The key challenge is that the past data typically   does not faithfully represent proportions of actions taken by a new   policy. Previous approaches rely either on models of rewards   or models of the past policy.  The former are plagued by a large bias   whereas the latter have a large variance.      In this work, we leverage the strength and   overcome the weaknesses of the two approaches by applying   the \emph{doubly robust} technique to the problems of   policy evaluation and optimization. We prove that this   approach yields accurate   value estimates when we have \emph{either}   a good (but not necessarily consistent) model of rewards   \emph{or} a good (but not necessarily consistent) model of past policy. Extensive empirical   comparison demonstrates that the doubly robust approach uniformly   improves over existing   techniques, achieving both lower variance in value estimation and better   policies.  As such, we   expect the doubly robust approach to become common practice.   </p>

In this work we propose deep energy models, a class of models that use a deep feedforward neural network to model the energy landscape that defines a probabilistic model. We are able to efficiently train all layers of our model at the same time, allowing the lower layers of the model to adapt to the training of the higher layers, producing better generative models. We evaluate the generative performance of our models on natural images and demonstrate that joint training of multiple layers yields qualitative and quantitative improvements over greedy layerwise training. We further generalize our models beyond the commonly used sigmoidal neural networks and show how a deep extension of the product of Student-t distributions model achieves good generative performance. Finally, we introduce a discriminative extension of our model and demonstrate that it outperforms other fully-connected models on object recognition on the NORB dataset.  </p>

<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>Minimization of the rank loss or, equivalently, maximization of the AUC in bipartite ranking calls for minimizing the number of disagreements between pairs of instances. Since the complexity of this problem is inherently quadratic in the number of training examples, it is tempting to ask how much is actually lost by minimizing a simple univariate loss function, as done by standard classification methods, as a surrogate. In this paper, we first note that minimization of 0/1 loss is not an option, as it may yield an arbitrarily high rank loss. We show, however, that better results can be achieved by means of a weighted (cost-sensitive) version of 0/1 loss. Yet, the real gain is obtained through margin-based loss functions, for which we are able to derive proper bounds, not only for rank risk but, more importantly, also for rank regret. The paper is completed with an experimental study in which we address specific questions raised by our theoretical analysis.   </p>

<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>Iterative methods that take steps in approximate subgradient directions have proved to be useful for stochastic learning problems over large or streaming data sets. When the objective consists of a loss function plus a nonsmooth regularization term, whose purpose is to induce structure (for example, sparsity) in the solution, the solution often lies on a low-dimensional manifold along which the regularizer is smooth. This paper shows that a regularized dual averaging algorithm can identify this manifold with high probability. This observation motivates an algorithmic strategy in which, once a near-optimal manifold is identified, we switch to an algorithm that searches only in this manifold, which typically has much lower intrinsic dimension than the full space, thus converging quickly to a near-optimal point with the desired structure. Computational results are presented to illustrate these claims. </p>

The observations are the noisy realizations of the sum of an (approximately) low rank matrix $\Theta^\star$ with a second matrix $\Gamma^\star$ endowed with a complementary form of low-dimensional structure. We derive a general theorem that gives upper bounds on the Frobenius norm error for an estimate of the pair $(\Theta^\star, \Gamma^\star)$ obtained by solving a convex optimization problem.  We then specialize our general result to two cases that have been studied in the context of robust PCA: low rank plus sparse structure, and low rank plus a column sparse structure.  Our theory yields Frobenius norm error bounds for both deterministic and stochastic noise matrices, and in the latter case, they are minimax optimal. The sharpness of our theoretical predictions is also confirmed in numerical simulations. </p>

Since there are exponentially many bundles, further assumptions on the valuation functions are needed. We make the assumption that the valuation function is supermodular and has non-linear interactions that are of low degree in a novel sense.

We also introduce a term, quadratic in the observed data that we exploit to guarantee the all conditionals associated with the model are well defined -- a guarantee that was absent in the original spike and slab RBM.  The inclusion of these generalizations improves the performance of the spike and slab RBM as a feature learner and achieves competitive performance on the CIFAR-10 image classification task.

We study outer relaxations of this problem that yield approximate marginal strategies for the players under a variety of utility functions. Results on simulated games and in a real problem involving drug design indicate that our approximations can be highly accurate and can be successfully used when exact computation of CE is infeasible. </p>

<span class='name'>Yan Yan, Romer Rosales, Glenn Fung, Jennifer Dy</span>
<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>Obtaining labels is expensive or time-consuming, but unlabeled data is often abundant and easy to obtain. Many learning task can profit from intelligently choosing unlabeled instances to be labeled by an oracle also known as active learning, instead of simply labeling all the data or randomly selecting data to be labeled. Supervised learning traditionally relies on an oracle playing the role of a teacher. In the multiple annotator paradigm, an oracle, who knows the ground truth, no longer exists; instead, multiple labelers, with varying expertise, are available for querying. This paradigm posits new challenges to the active learning scenario.  We can ask which data sample should be labeled next and which annotator should we query to benefit our learning model the most.  In this paper, we develop a probabilistic model for learning from multiple annotators that can also learn the annotator expertise even when their expertise may not be consistently accurate (or inaccurate) across the task domain. In addition, we provide an optimization formulation that allows us to simultaneously learn the most uncertain sample and the annotator/s to query the labels from for active learning. Our active learning approach combines both intelligently selecting samples to label and learning from expertise among multiple labelers to improve learning performance. </p>

<span class='name'>Kevin Waugh, Brian Ziebart, Drew Bagnell</span>
<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>Modeling the purposeful behavior of imperfect agents from a small number of observations is a challenging task.  When restricted to the single-agent decision-theoretic setting, inverse optimal control techniques assume that observed behavior is an approximately optimal solution to an unknown decision problem.  These techniques learn a utility function that explains the example behavior and can then be used to accurately predict or imitate future behavior in similar observed or unobserved situations.  In this work, we consider similar tasks in competitive and cooperative multi-agent domains.  Here, unlike single-agent settings, a player cannot myopically maximize its reward --- it must speculate on how the other agents may act to influence the game's outcome.  Employing the game-theoretic notion of regret and the principle of maximum entropy, we introduce a technique for predicting and generalizing behavior, as well as recovering a reward function in these domains. </p>

<span class='name'>Mohammad Ghavamzadeh, Alessandro Lazaric, Remi Munos, Matthew Hoffman</span>
<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>In this paper, we analyze the performance of Lasso-TD, a modification of LSTD in which the projection operator is defined as a Lasso problem. We first show that Lasso-TD is guaranteed to have a unique fixed point and its algorithmic implementation coincides with the recently presented LARS-TD and LC-TD methods. We then derive two bounds on the prediction error of Lasso-TD in the Markov design setting, i.e., when the performance is evaluated on the same states used by the method. The first bound makes no assumption, but has a slow rate w.r.t. the number of samples. The second bound is under an assumption on the empirical Gram matrix, called the compatibility condition, but has an improved rate and directly relates the prediction error to the sparsity of the value function in the feature space at hand.  </p>

<span class='name'>Jason Pazis, Ron Parr</span>
<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>The majority of value function approximation based reinforcement learning algorithms available today, focus on approximating the state (V) or state-action (Q) value function and efficient action selection comes as an afterthought. On the other hand, real-world problems tend to have large action spaces, where evaluating every possible action becomes impractical. This mismatch presents a major obstacle in successfully applying reinforcement learning to real-world problems.  In this paper we present a unified view of V and Q functions and arrive at a new space-efficient representation, where action selection can be done exponentially faster, without the use of a model. We then describe how to calculate this new value function efficiently via approximate linear programming and provide experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. </p>

<span class='name'>Alex Kulesza, Ben  Taskar</span>
<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>Determinantal point processes (DPPs) have recently been proposed as models for set selection problems where diversity is preferred.  For example, they can be used to select diverse sets of sentences to form document summaries, or to find multiple non-overlapping human poses in an image.  However, DPPs conflate the modeling of two distinct characteristics: the size of the set, and its content. For many realistic tasks, the size of the desired set is known up front; e.g., in search we may want to show the user exactly ten results.  In these situations the effort spent by DPPs modeling set size is not only wasteful, but actually introduces unwanted bias into the modeling of content.  Instead, we propose the k-DPP, a conditional DPP that models only sets of cardinality k.  In exchange for this restriction, k-DPPs offer greater expressiveness and control over content, and simplified integration into applications like search.  We derive algorithms for efficiently normalizing, sampling, and marginalizing k-DPPs, and propose an experts-style algorithm for learning combinations of k-DPPs.  We demonstrate the  usefulness of the model on an image search task, where k-DPPs significantly outperform MMR as judged by human annotators. </p>

<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>We consider estimation methods for the class of continuous-data energy based models (EBMs). Our main result shows that estimating the parameters of an EBM using score matching when the conditional distribution over the visible units is Gaussian corresponds to training a particular form of regularized autoencoder. We show how different Gaussian EBMs lead to different autoencoder architectures, providing deep links between these two families of models. We compare the score matching estimator for the mPoT model, a particular Gaussian EBM, to several other training methods on a variety of tasks including image denoising and unsupervised feature extraction. We show that the regularization function induced by score matching leads to superior classification performance relative to a standard autoencoder. We also show that score matching yields classification results that are indistinguishable from better-known stochastic approximation  maximum likelihood estimators. </p>

<span class='name'>Alexander Grubb, Drew Bagnell</span>
<p style='width:66em;font-size:11px;'><span style='font-weight:bold;'>Abstract:</span>Boosting is a popular way to derive powerful learners from simpler hypothesis classes.  Following previous work (Mason et al., 1999; Friedman, 2000) on general boosting frameworks, we analyze gradient-based descent algorithms for boosting with respect to any convex objective and introduce a new measure of weak learner performance into this setting which generalizes existing work. We present the first weak to strong learning guarantees for the existing gradient boosting work for smooth convex objectives, and also demonstrate that this work fails for non-smooth objectives. To address this issue, we present new algorithms which extend this boosting approach to arbitrary convex loss functions and give corresponding weak to strong convergence results. In addition, we demonstrate experimental results that support our analysis and demonstrate the need for the new algorithms we present.  </p>
