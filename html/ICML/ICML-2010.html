        <h3>Web-Scale Bayesian Click-Through Rate Prediction for Sponsored Search Advertising in Microsoft&rsquo;s Bing Search Engine</h3> 
        <p><em>Thore Graepel  (Microsoft Research); Joaquin Qui�onero Candela  (Microsoft Research); Thomas Borchert  (Microsoft Research); Ralf Herbrich (Microsoft Research)</em></p> 
        <p class="abstracts">We describe a new Bayesian click-through rate (CTR) prediction algorithm used for Sponsored Search in Microsoft&rsquo;s Bing search engine. The algorithm is based on a probit regression model that maps discrete or real-valued input features to probabilities. It maintains Gaussian beliefs over weights of the model and performs Gaussian online updates derived from approximate message passing. Scalability of the algorithm is ensured through a principled weight pruning procedure and an approximate parallel implementation. We discuss the challenges arising from evaluating and tuning the predictor as part of the complex system of sponsored search where the predictions made by the algorithm decide about future training sample composition. Finally, we show experimental results from the production system and compare to a calibrated Na&iuml;ve Bayes algorithm.</p>

<h3>Detecting Large-Scale System Problems by Mining Console Logs</h3> 
<p><em>Wei Xu (UC Berkeley); Ling Huang (Intel Labs Berkeley);  Armando Fox (UC Berkeley); David Patterson (UC Berkeley); Michael I. Jordan (UC Berkeley)</em></p> 
<p class="abstracts">Surprisingly, console logs rarely help operators detect problems in large-scale datacenter services, for they often consist of the voluminous intermixing of messages from many 
  software components written by independent 
  developers. We propose a general methodology to mine this rich source of information to automatically detect system runtime<br />
  problems. We use a combination of program
  analysis and information retrieval techniques 
  to transform free-text console logs into numerical features, which captures sequences of 
  events in the system. We then analyze these 
  features using machine learning to detect operational problems. We also show how to distill the results of our analysis to an operator-friendly one-page decision tree showing the 
  critical messages associated with the detected 
  problems. In addition, we extend our methods to online problem detection where the sequences of events are continuously generated 
  as data streams.</p>

<p><em>Chid Apte (IBM T. J. Watson Research Center)</em></p> 
<p class="abstracts">In a trend that reflects the increasing demand for 
  intelligent applications driven by business data, IBM 
  today is building out a significant number of applications 
  that leverage machine learning technologies to optimize 
  business process decisions. This talk highlights this trend; 
  and describes the many different ways in which leading

<p><em>Christopher Raphael (Indiana University)</em></p> 
<p class="abstracts">A system for musical accompaniment is presented 
  in which a computer-driven orchestra 
  follows and learns from a soloist in a 
  concerto-like setting. The system is decomposed 
  into three modules: the first computes 
  a real-time score match using a hidden 
  Markov model; the second generates the 
  output audio by phase-vocoding a preexisting 
  audio recording; the third provides a link between 
  these two, by predicting future timing 
  evolution using a Kalman filter-like model. 
  Several examples are presented showing the 
  system in action in diverse musical settings. 
  Connections with machine learning are highlighted, 
  showing current weaknesses and new 
  possible directions.</p>

<p><em>Benjamin Snyder (MIT); Regina Barzilay (MIT)</em></p> 
<p class="abstracts">For centuries, scholars have explored the deep 
  links among human languages. In this paper,

<p><em>Mark Cummins (University of Oxford); Paul Newman (University of Oxford)</em></p> 
<p class="abstracts">We present an overview of FAB-MAP, an algorithm for place recognition and mapping developed for infrastructure-free mobile robot navigation in large environments. The system allows a robot to identify when it is revisiting a previously seen location, on the basis of imagery captured by the robot's camera. We outline a complete probabilistic framework for the task, which is applicable even in visually repetitive environments where many locations may appear identical. Our work introduces a number of technical innovations - notably we demonstrate that place recognition performance can be improved by learning an approximation to the joint distribution over visual elements. We also investigate several principled approaches to making the system robust in visually repetitive environments, and define an efficient bail-out strategy for multi-hypothesis testing to improve system speed. Our model has been shown to substantially outperform standard tf-idf ranking on our task of interest. We demonstrate the system performing reliable online appearance mapping and loop closure detection over a 1,000km trajectory, with mean filter update times of 14 ms.</p>

<p><em>Pedro Felzenszwalb (University of Chicago); Ross Girshick (University of Chicago); David McAllester (Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago); Deva Ramanan (UC Irvine)</em></p> 
<p class="abstracts">In this talk, I will discuss recent work by colleagues and myself on discriminative latent-variable models for object detection. Object recognition is one of the fundamental challenges of computer vision. We specifically consider the task of localizing and detecting instances of a generic object category, such as people or cars, in cluttered real-word images. Recent benchmark competitions such as the PASCAL Visual Object Challenge suggest our method is the state-of-the-art system for such tasks. This success, combined with publically-available code that runs orders of magnitude faster than comparable approaches, has turned our system into a standard baseline for contemporary research on object recognition.</p>

        <p><em>Wei Liu (Columbia University); Junfeng He; Shih-Fu Chang</em></p> 
        <p class="abstracts">In this paper, we address the scalability issue plaguing graph-based semi-supervised learning viaa small number of anchor points which adequately cover the entire point cloud. Critically, these anchor points enable nonparametric regression that predicts the label for each data point as a locally weighted average of the labels on anchor points. Because conventional graph construction is inefficient in large scale, we propose to construct a tractable large graph by couplinganchor-based label prediction and adjacency matrix design. Contrary to the Nystrom approximation of adjacency matrices which results in indefinite graph Laplacians and in turn leads to potential non-convex optimization over graphs, the proposed graph construction approach based on a unique idea called AnchorGraph provides nonnegative adjacency matrices to guarantee positive semidefinite graph Laplacians. Our approach scales linearly with the data size and in practice usually produces a large sparse graph. Experiments on large datasets demonstrate the significant accuracy improvement and scalability of the proposed approach.</p><p class="discussion">[<a href="papers/16.pdf">Full Paper</a>] <span>[<a href="http://mldiscuss.appspot.com/discuss/16">Discussion</a>]</span></p><br /><hr><br />
<a name="23"></a><p>Paper ID: 23</p> <h3>Boosting Classifiers with Tightened L0-Relaxation Penalties</h3> <p><em>Noam Goldberg (Technion); Jonathan Eckstein</em></p> <p class="abstracts">We propose a novel boosting algorithm which improves on current algorithms for weighted voting classification in striking a better balance between classification accuracy and sparsity of the weight vector. In order to justify our optimization formulations, we first consider a novel integer linear program as a model forsparse classifier selection, generalizing the minimum disagreementhalfspace problem, whose complexity has been investigated in computational learning theory. Specifically, our mixed integer problem is that of finding a separating hyperplane with minimum empirical error subject to an L0-norm penalty. We find that common soft margin linear programming formulations for robust classification are equivalent to a continuous relaxation of our model. Since the initial continuous relaxation is weak, we suggesta tighter relaxation, using novel cutting planes, to better approximate the integer solution.  To solve this relaxation, we propose a new boosting algorithm based on linear programming with dynamic generation of variables and constraints. We demonstrate the classification performance of our proposed algorithm with experimental results, and justify our selection of parameters using a minimum description length, compression intrepretation of learning.</p><p class="discussion">[<a href="papers/23.pdf">Full Paper</a>] <span>[<a href="http://mldiscuss.appspot.com/discuss/23">Discussion</a>]</span></p><br /><hr><br />

The difficulty originates not only from the lack of class information but also the fact that high-dimensional data are often multifaceted and can be meaningfully clustered in multiple ways. In such a case the effort to find one subset of attributes that presumably gives the ``best'' clustering may be misguided. It makes more sense to facilitate variable selection by domain experts, that is, to systematically identify various facets of a data set (each being based on a subset of attributes), cluster the data along each one, and present the results to the domain experts for appraisal and selection. In this paper, we propose a generalization of the Gaussian mixture model, show its ability to  cluster data along multiple facets, and demonstrate it is often more reasonable to facilitate variable selection than to perform it.</p><p class="discussion">[<a href="papers/26.pdf">Full Paper</a>] <span>[<a href="http://mldiscuss.appspot.com/discuss/26">Discussion</a>]</span></p><br /><hr><br />

However, there are many important distributions with elements of interaction and feedback where its applicability has not been established.  This work presents the principle of maximum causal entropy--an approach based on causally conditioned probabilities that can appropriately model the availability and influence of sequentially revealed side information.  Using this principle, we derive models for sequential data with revealed information, interaction, and feedback, and demonstrate their applicability for statistically framing inverse optimal control and decision prediction tasks.</p><p class="discussion">[<a href="papers/28.pdf">Full Paper</a>] <span>[<a href="http://mldiscuss.appspot.com/discuss/28">Discussion</a>]</span></p><br /><hr><br />

We discuss uniqueness and boundedness of the optimal solution of the maximization problem. A block coordinate descent method leads to a provably convergent algorithm that generates a sequence of positive definite solutions. Thus, we reduce the original problem into a sequence of strictly convex $\ell_\infty$ regularized quadratic minimization subproblems. We further show that this subproblem leads to the continuous quadratic knapsack problem, for which very efficient methods exist. Finally, we show promising results in a dataset that captures brain function of cocaine addicted and control subjects under conditions of monetary reward.</p><p class="discussion">[<a href="papers/35.pdf">Full Paper</a>] <span>[<a href="http://mldiscuss.appspot.com/discuss/35">Discussion</a>]</span></p><br /><hr><br />

SAM maintains the same hierarchical structure as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), but models documents as points on a high-dimensional spherical manifold, allowing a natural likelihood parameterization in terms of cosine distance. Furthermore, SAM topics are capable of assigning negative weight to terms and can model word absence/presence unlike previous models. Performance is evaluated empirically both subjectively as a topic model using human raters and across several disparate classification tasks, from natural language processing and computer vision.</p><p class="discussion">[<a href="papers/45.pdf">Full Paper</a>] <span>[<a href="http://mldiscuss.appspot.com/discuss/45">Discussion</a>]</span></p><br /><hr><br />

Large and rich sets of features can cause the existing algorithms to overfit because of the limited number of samples. We address this shortcoming using L_1 regularization in approximate linear programming. Because the proposed method can automatically select the appropriate richness of features, its performance does not degrade with an increasing number of features. These results rely on new and stronger sampling bounds for regularized approximate linear programs.  We also propose a computationally efficient homotopy method. The empirical evaluation of the approach shows that the proposed method performs well on simple MDPs and standard benchmark problems.</p><p class="discussion">[<a href="papers/52.pdf">Full Paper</a>] <span>[<a href="http://mldiscuss.appspot.com/discuss/52">Discussion</a>]</span></p><br /><hr><br />

<p><em>Bruno Bouzy (Universit&#233; Paris Descartes); Marc Metivier (Universit&eacute; Paris Descartes)</em></p> <p class="abstracts">This paper experimentally evaluates multi-agent learning algorithms playing repeated matrix games to maximize their cumulative return. Previous works assessed that Q-learning surpassed Nash-based multi-agent learning algorithms. Based on all-against-all repeated matrix game tournaments, this paper updates the state of the art of multi-agent learning experiments. In a first stage, it shows that M-Qubed, S and bandit-based algorithms such as UCB are the best algorithms on general-sum games, Exp3 being the best on cooperative games and zero-sum games. In a second stage, our experiments show that two features - forgetting the far past, and using recent history with states - improve the learning algorithms. Finally, the best algorithms are two new algorithms, Q-learning and UCB enhanced with the two features, and M-Qubed.</p><p class="discussion">[<a href="papers/76.pdf">Full Paper</a>] <span>[<a href="http://mldiscuss.appspot.com/discuss/76">Discussion</a>]</span></p><br /><hr><br />

A recent approach to decision-theoretic planning in relational domains uses forward inference in dynamic Bayesian networks compiled from learned probabilistic relational rules. Inspired by work in non-relational domains with small state spaces, we derive a backpropagation method for such nets in relational domains starting from a goal state mixture distribution. We combine this with forward reasoning in a bidirectional two-filter approach. We perform experiments in a complex 3D simulated desktop environment with an articulated manipulator and realistic physics. Empirical results show that bidirectional probabilistic reasoning can lead to more efficient and accurate planning in comparison to pure forward reasoning.</p><p class="discussion">[<a href="papers/77.pdf">Full Paper</a>] <span>[<a href="http://mldiscuss.appspot.com/discuss/77">Discussion</a>]</span></p><br /><hr><br />

<p class="abstracts">The importance of bringing causality intoplay when designing feature selection methods is more and more acknowledged in the machine learning community. This paper proposes a filter approach based on information theory which aimsto prioritise direct causal relationships in feature selection problems where the ratio between the numberof features and the number of samples is high. This approach is based on thenotion of interaction which is shown to be informative about the relevance of an input subset as well asits causal relationship with the target.The resulting filter, called mIMR (min-Interaction Max-Relevance), is compared with state-of-the-art approaches. Classification results on 25 real microarray datasets show thatthe incorporation of causal aspects in the feature assessment is beneficial both for the resulting accuracy and stability. A toy example of causal discovery shows the effectivenessof the filter for identifying direct causal relationships. </p><p class="discussion">[<a href="papers/78.pdf">Full Paper</a>] <span>[<a href="http://mldiscuss.appspot.com/discuss/78">Discussion</a>]</span></p><br /><hr><br />

MI-CRF models bags as nodes in a CRF with instances as their states. It combines discriminative unary instance classifiers and pairwise dissimilarity measures.

This makes it possible to classify test bags in an imputation setup. The parameters of MI-CRF are learned using constraint generation. Furthermore, we show that MI-CRF can incorporate previous MIL algorithms to improve on their results.

Most existing work relies on domain knowledge to construct complex handcrafted features from inputs. In addition, the environments are usually assumed to be controlled. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a type of deep models that can act directly on the raw inputs, thus automating the process of feature construction. However, such models are currently limited to handle 2D inputs. In this paper, we develop a novel 3D CNN model for action recognition. This model extracts features from both spatial and temporal dimensions by performing 3D convolutions, thereby capturing the motion information encoded in multiple adjacent frames. The developed model generates multiple channels of information from the input frames, and the final feature representation is obtained by combining information from all channels. We apply the developed model to recognize human actions in real-world environment, and it achieves superior performance without relying on handcrafted features.</p><p class="discussion">[<a href="papers/100.pdf">Full Paper</a>] <span>[<a href="http://mldiscuss.appspot.com/discuss/100">Discussion</a>]</span></p><br /><hr><br />

In this paper, we introduce the generalization of maximum entropy model and propose a framework for learning from noisy side information based on the generalized maximum entropy model.

<p><em>Xindong Wu (University of Vermont); Kui Yu (Hefei University of Technology); Hao Wang (Hefei University of Technology); Wei Ding (University of Massachusetts Boston)</em></p> <p class="abstracts">We study an interesting and challenging problem, online streaming feature selection, in which the size of the feature set is unknown, and not all features are available for learning while leaving the number of observations constant. In this problem, the candidate features arrive one at a time, and the learner's task is to select a �best so far� set of features from streaming features. Standard feature selection methods cannot perform well in this scenario. Thus, we present a novel framework based on feature relevance. Under this framework, a promising alternative method, Online Streaming Feature Selection (OSFS), is presented to online select strongly relevant and non-redundant features. In addition to OSFS, a faster Fast-OSFS algorithm is proposed to further improve the selection efficiency. Experimental results show that our algorithms achieve more compactness and better accuracy than existing streaming feature selection algorithms on various datasets.</p><p class="discussion">[<a href="papers/238.pdf">Full Paper</a>] <span>[<a href="http://mldiscuss.appspot.com/discuss/238">Discussion</a>]</span></p><br /><hr><br />

<p class="abstracts">The Nystrom method is an efficient technique for the eigen value decomposition of large kernel matrices. However, in order to ensure an accurate approximation, a sufficiently large number of columns have to be sampled. On very large data sets, the SVD step on the resultant data sub matrix will soon dominate the computations and become prohibitive. In this paper, we propose an accurate and scalable Nystrom scheme that first samples a large column subset from the input matrix, but then only performs an approximate SVD on the inner sub matrix by using the recent randomized low-rank matrix approximation algorithms. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed algorithm is as accurate as the standard Nystrom method that directly performs a large SVD on the inner sub matrix On the other hand, its time complexity is only as low as performing a small SVD. Experiments are performed on a number of large-scale data sets for low-rank approximation and spectral embedding. In particular, spectral embedding of a MNIST data set with 3.3 million examples takes less than an hour on a standard PC with 4G memory.</p><p class="discussion">[<a href="papers/242.pdf">Full Paper</a>] <span>[<a href="http://mldiscuss.appspot.com/discuss/242">Discussion</a>]</span></p><br /><hr><br />

<p class="abstracts">Learning undirected graphical models such as Markov random fields is an important machine learning task with applications in many domains.  Since it is usually intractable to learn these models exactly, various approximate learning techniques have been developed, such as contrastive divergence (CD) and Markov chain Monte Carlo maximum likelihood estimation (MCMC-MLE).  In this paper, we introduce particle filtered MCMC-MLE, which is a sampling-importance-re sampling version of MCMC-MLE with additional MCMC rejuvenation steps.  We also describe a unified view of (1) MCMC-MLE, (2) our particle filtering approach, and (3) a stochastic approximation procedure known as persistent contrastive divergence.  We show how these approaches are related to each other and discuss the relative merits of each approach.  Empirical results on various undirected models demonstrate that the particle filtering technique we propose in this paper can significantly outperform MCMC-MLE.  Furthermore, in certain cases, the proposed technique is faster than persistent CD.</p><p class="discussion">[<a href="papers/246.pdf">Full Paper</a>] <span>[<a href="http://mldiscuss.appspot.com/discuss/246">Discussion</a>]</span></p><br /><hr><br />

<p><em>Robert Busa-Fekete (CNRS / Universit&eacute; Paris-Sud 11); Balazs Kegl (LAL/LRI Universit&eacute; Paris-Sud, CNRS)</em></p> <p class="abstracts">In this paper we apply multi-armed bandits (MABs) to improve the computational complexity of AdaBoost. AdaBoost constructs a strong classifier in a stepwise fashion by selecting simple base classifiers and using their weighted ``vote'' to determine the final classification. We model this stepwise base classifier selection as a sequential decision problem, and optimize it with MABs where each arm represents a subset of the base classifier set. The MAB gradually learns the ``usefulness'' of the subsets, and selects one of the subsets in each iteration. AdaBoost then searches only this subset instead of optimizing the base classifier over the whole space. The main improvement of this paper over a previous approach is that we use an adversarial bandit algorithm instead of stochastic bandits. This choice allows us to prove a weak-to-strong-learning theorem, which means that the proposed technique remains a boosting algorithm in a formal sense. We demonstrate on benchmark datasets that our technique can achieve a generalization performance similar to standard AdaBoost for a computational cost that is an order of magnitude smaller.</p><p class="discussion">[<a href="papers/263.pdf">Full Paper</a>] <span>[<a href="http://mldiscuss.appspot.com/discuss/263">Discussion</a>]</span></p><br /><hr><br />

<p class="abstracts">The problem of clustering is considered, for the case when each data point is a sample generated by a stationary ergodic process. We propose a very natural asymptotic notion of consistency,and show that simple consistent  algorithms exist, under most general non-parametric assumptions. The notion of consistency is as follows: two samples should be put into the same cluster if and only if they we regenerated by the same distribution. With this notion of consistency, clustering generalizes such classical statistical problems as homogeneity testing and process classification.  We show that, for the case of a known number of clusters, consistency can be achieved under the only assumption that the joint distribution of the data is stationary ergodic (no parametric or Markovian assumptions, no assumptions of independence, neither between nor within the samples). If the number of clusters is unknown, consistency can be achieved under appropriate assumptions on the mixing rates of the processes (again, no parametric or independence assumptions). In both cases we give examples of simple (at most quadratic in each argument) algorithms which are consistent. </p><p class="discussion">[<a href="papers/279.pdf">Full Paper</a>] <span>[<a href="http://mldiscuss.appspot.com/discuss/279">Discussion</a>]</span></p><br /><hr><br />

Using the kernel trick, they work on several domains and even enable heterogeneous data fusion by concatenating feature spaces or multiple kernel learning. Unfortunately, they are not suited for truly large-scale applications since they suffer from the curse of supporting vectors, i.e., the speed of applying SVMs decays linearly with the number of support vectors.  In this paper we develop COFFIN --- a new training strategy for linear SVMs that effectively allows the use of on demand computed kernel feature spaces and virtual examples in the primal. With linear training and prediction effort this framework leverages SVM applications to truly large-scale problems: As an example, we train SVMs for human splice site recognition involving 50 million examples and sophisticated string kernels.

However, TD(lambda) chooses a very specific way of averaging these estimators based on the fixed parameter lambda, which may not lead to optimal convergence rates in all settings.  In this paper, we derive an automated Bayesian approach to setting lambda that we call temporal difference Bayesian model averaging (TD-BMA).  Empirically, TD-BMA always performs as well and often much better than the best fixed lambda for TD(lambda) (even when performance for different values of lambda varies across problems) without requiring that lambda or any analogous parameter be manually tuned.</p><p class="discussion">[<a href="papers/295.pdf">Full Paper</a>] <span>[<a href="http://mldiscuss.appspot.com/discuss/295">Discussion</a>]</span></p><br /><hr><br />

<p class="abstracts">In global optimization, when the evaluation of the target function is costly, the usual strategy is to learn a surrogate model for the target function and replace the initial optimization by the optimization of the model.  Gaussian processes have been widely used since they provide an elegant way to model the fitness and to deal with the exploration-exploitation trade-off in a principled way. Several empirical criteria have been proposed to drive the model optimization, among which is the well-known Expected Improvement criterion. The major computational bottleneck of these algorithms is the exhaustive grid search used to optimize the highly multi modal merit function. In this paper, we propose a competitive ``adaptive grid'' approach, based on a properly derived Cross-Entropy optimization algorithm with mixture proposals. Experiments suggest that 1) we outperform the classical single-Gaussian cross-entropy method when the fitness function is highly multi modal, and 2) we improve on standard exhaustive search in GP-based surrogate optimization.</p><p class="discussion">[<a href="papers/297.pdf">Full Paper</a>] <span>[<a href="http://mldiscuss.appspot.com/discuss/297">Discussion</a>]</span></p><br /><hr><br />

Usually not all of these dimensions are relevant and some are redundant. There are two main approaches to reduce dimensionality: feature selection and feature transformation. When one wishes to keep the original meaning of the features, feature selection is desired. Feature selection and transformation are typically presented separately. In this paper, we introduce a general approach for converting transformation-based methods to feature selection methods through L_1/L_infty regularization. Instead of solving feature selection as a discrete optimization, we relax and formulate the problem as a continuous optimization problem. An additional advantage of our formulation is that our optimization criterion optimizes for feature relevance and redundancy removal automatically. Here, we illustrate how our approach can be utilized to convert linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and the dimensionality reduction version of the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) to two new feature selection algorithms.

<h3>Large Scale Max-Margin Multi-Label Classification with Priors</h3> <p><em>Bharath Hariharan (Indian Institute of Technology Delhi); Lihi Zelnik-Manor (Technion); S.V.N. Vishwanathan (Purdue); Manik Varma (Microsoft Research India)</em></p> 
<p class="abstracts">We propose a max-margin formulation for the multi-label classification problem where the goal is to tag a data point with a set of pre-specified labels. Given a set of $L$ labels, a data point can be tagged with any of the $2^L$ possible subsets. The main challenge therefore lies in optimizing over this exponentially large label space subject to label correlations .Existing solutions take either of two approaches. The first assumes, it a priori , that there are no label correlations and independently trains a classifier for each label (as is done in the 1-vs-Allheuristic). This reduces the problem complexity from exponential to linear and such methods can scale to large problems. The second approach explicitly models correlations by pair wise label interactions. However, the complexity remains exponential unless one assumes that label correlations are sparse. Furthermore, the learnt correlations reflect the  training set biases.We take a middle approach that assumes labels are correlated but does not incorporate pair wise label terms in the prediction function. We show that the complexity can still be reduced from exponential to linear while modeling dense pair wise label correlations. By incorporating correlation priors we can overcome training set biases and improve prediction accuracy. We provide a principled interpretation of the 1-vs-All method and show that it arises as a special case of our formulation. We also develop efficient optimization algorithms that can be orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art.</p><p class="discussion">[<a href="papers/344.pdf">Full Paper</a>] <span>[<a href="http://mldiscuss.appspot.com/discuss/344">Discussion</a>]</span></p><br /><hr><br />

Our structured regularization is based on a group-lasso penalty, where groups are defined with respect to the tree structure. We describe a systematic weighting scheme for the groups in the penalty such that each output variable is penalized in a balanced manner even if the groups overlap.We present an efficient optimization method that can handle a large-scale problem. % as is typically the case in association mapping.

<p class="abstracts">We develop an efficient learning framework to construct signal dictionaries for sparse representation by selecting the dictionary columns from multiple candidate bases. By sparse, we mean that only a few dictionary elements, compared to the ambient signal dimension, can exactly represent or well-approximate the signals of interest. We formulate both the selection of the dictionary columns and the sparse representation of signals as a joint combinatorial optimization problem. The proposed combinatorial objective maximizes variance reduction over the set of training signals by constraining the size of the dictionary as well as the number of dictionary columns that can be used to represent each signal. We show that if the available dictionary column vectors are incoherent, our objective function satisfies approximate submodularity. We exploit this property to develop SDSOMP and SDSMA, two greedy algorithms with approximation guarantees. We also describe how our learning framework enables dictionary selection for structured sparse representations, e.g., where the sparse coefficients occur in restricted patterns.

<p class="abstracts">Dimensionality reduction is a commonly used step in many algorithms for visualization, classification, clustering and modeling. Most dimensionality reduction algorithms find a low dimensional embedding that preserves the structure of high-dimensional data points. This paper proposes Local Minima Embedding (LME), a technique to find a low-dimensional embedding that preserves the local minima structure of a given objective function. LME  provides an embedding that is useful for visualizing and understanding the relation between the original variables that create local minima. Additionally, the embedding can potentially be used to sample the original function to discover new local minima. The function in the embedded space takes an analytic form and hence the gradients can be computed analytically. We illustrate the benefits of LME in both synthetic data and real problems in the context of image alignment. To the best of our knowledge this is the first paper that addresses the problem of finding an embedding that preserves local minima properties of an objective function.</p><p class="discussion">[<a href="papers/374.pdf">Full Paper</a>] <span>[<a href="http://mldiscuss.appspot.com/discuss/374">Discussion</a>]</span></p><br /><hr><br />

<p class="abstracts">A new procedure for learning cost-sensitive SVM classifiers is proposed. The SVM hinge loss is extended to the cost sensitive setting, and the cost-sensitive SVM is derived as the minimizer of the associated risk. The extension of the hinge loss draws on recent connections between risk minimization and probability elicitation. These connections are generalized to cost-sensitive classification, in a manner that guarantees consistency with the cost-sensitive Bayes risk, and associated Bayes decision rule. This ensures that optimal decision rules, under the new hinge loss, implement the Bayes-optimal cost-sensitive classification boundary.  Minimization of the new hinge loss is shown to be a generalization of the classic SVM optimization problem, and can be solved by identical procedures. The resulting algorithm avoids the shortcomings of previous approaches to cost-sensitive SVM design, and has superior experimental performance.</p><p class="discussion">[<a href="papers/376.pdf">Full Paper</a>] <span>[<a href="http://mldiscuss.appspot.com/discuss/376">Discussion</a>]</span></p><br /><hr><br />

Though powerful, the HDP makes an assumption that the probability of a component being exhibited by a data point is positively correlated with its proportion within that data point. This might be an undesirable assumption.  For example, in topic modeling, a topic (component) might be rare throughout the corpus but dominant within those documents (data points) where it occurs.  We develop the IBP compound Dirichlet process (ICD), a Bayesian nonparametric prior that decouples across-data prevalence and within-data proportion in a mixed membership model.  The ICD combines properties from the HDP and the Indian buffet process (IBP), a Bayesian nonparametric prior on binary matrices.  The ICD assigns a subset of the shared mixture components to each data point.  This subset, the data point's ``focus'', is determined independently from the amount that each of its components contribute.

We focus on the budgeted learning setting, where there is a known fixed cost c_i for acquiring the value of the i-th feature for any specified instance, and a known total cost to spend acquiring all information. After formally defining this problem from a Bayesian perspective, we first consider allocation algorithms that must decide, before seeing any results, which features of which instances to probe. We show this is NP-hard, even if all variables are independent, then prove that the greedy allocation algorithm IGA is optimal when the costs are uniform and the features are independent, but can otherwise be sub-optimal. We then show that general (non-allocation) policies perform better, and explore the challenges of learning the parameters for general belief networks in this setting, describing conditions for when the obvious round-robin algorithm will, versus will not work optimally.

(2008) exploited the special structure of the learning problem to achieve faster convergence. In this paper, we investigate a natural way of combining these two directions to yield fast and robust learning algorithms.</p><p class="discussion">[<a href="papers/438.pdf">Full Paper</a>] <span>[<a href="http://mldiscuss.appspot.com/discuss/438">Discussion</a>]</span></p><br /><hr><br />

The commonly used Gibbs sampler tends to get trapped in one local mode, which often results in unstable learning dynamics and leads to poor parameter estimates. In this paper, we concentrate on learning DBM's using adaptive MCMC algorithms. We first show a close connection between Fast PCD and adaptive MCMC. We then develop a Coupled Adaptive Simulated Tempering algorithm that can be used to better explore a highly multimodal energy landscape. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm considerably improves parameter estimates, particularly when learning large-scale DBM's.</p><p class="discussion">[<a href="papers/441.pdf">Full Paper</a>] <span>[<a href="http://mldiscuss.appspot.com/discuss/441">Discussion</a>]</span></p><br /><hr><br />

We extend agent design to include the meta-optimization problem of selecting internal agent goals (rewards)which optimize the designer's goals. Our claim is that well-designed internal rewards can help improve the performance of RL agents which are computationally bounded in some way (as practical agents are).  We present a formal framework for understanding both bounded agents and the meta-optimization problem, and we empirically demonstrate several instances of common agent bounds being mitigated by general internal reward functions.</p><p class="discussion">[<a href="papers/442.pdf">Full Paper</a>] <span>[<a href="http://mldiscuss.appspot.com/discuss/422">Discussion</a>]</span></p><br /><hr><br />

<p class="abstracts">In Sparse Coding (SC), input vectors are reconstructed using a sparse linear combination of basis vectors. SC has become a popular method for extracting features from data. For a given input, SC minimizes a quadratic reconstruction error with an L1 penalty term on the code. The process is often too slow for applications such as real-time pattern recognition. We proposed two versions of a very fast algorithm that produces approximate estimates of the sparse code that can be used to compute good visual features, or to initialize exact iterative algorithms. The main idea is to train a non-linear, feed-forward predictor with a specific architecture and a fixed depth to produce the best possible approximation of the sparse code. A version of the method, which can be seen as a trainable version of Li and Osher's coordinate descent method, is shown to produce approximate solutions with 10 times less computation than Li and Osher's for the same approximation error.  Unlike previous proposals for sparse code predictors, the system allows a kind of approximate explaining away to take place during inference. The resulting predictor is differentiable and can be included into globally-trained recognition systems.</p><p class="discussion">[<a href="papers/449.pdf">Full Paper</a>] <span>[<a href="http://mldiscuss.appspot.com/discuss/449">Discussion</a>]</span></p><br /><hr><br />

Many such existing systems rely on learning algorithms which are based on simple parametric gradient descent where the parametrization must be predetermined, or more specialized per-application algorithms which are usually ad-hoc and complicated. We present a novel approach for training generic modular networks that uses two existing techniques: the error propagation strategy of backpropagation and more recent research on descent in spaces of functions (Mason et al., 1999; Scholkopf & Smola, 2001). Combining these two methods of optimization gives a simple algorithm for training heterogeneous networks of functional modules using simple gradient propagation mechanics and established learning algorithms. The resulting separation of concerns between learning individual modules and error propagation mechanics eases implementation, enables a larger class of modular learning strategies, and allows per-module control of complexity/regularization. We derive and demonstrate this functional backpropagation and contrast it with traditional gradient descent in parameter space, observing that in our example domain the method is significantly more robust to local optima.</p><p class="discussion">[<a href="papers/451.pdf">Full Paper</a>] <span>[<a href="http://mldiscuss.appspot.com/discuss/451">Discussion</a>]</span></p><br /><hr><br />

<p class="abstracts">Local Coordinate Coding (LCC), introduced in (Yu et al., 2009), is a high dimensional nonlinear learning method that explicitly takes advantage of the geometric structure of the data. Its successful use in the winning system of last year's Pascal image classification Challenge (Everingham, 2009) shows that the ability to integrate geometric information is critical for some real world machine learning applications. This paper further develops the idea of integrating geometry in machine learning by extending the original LCC method to include local tangent directions. These new correction terms lead to better approximation of high dimensional nonlinear functions when the underlying data manifold is locally flat. The method significantly reduces the number of anchor points needed in LCC, which not only reduces computational cost, but also improves prediction performance. Experiments are included to demonstrate that this method is more effective than the original LCC method on some image classification tasks.</p><p class="discussion">[<a href="papers/454.pdf">Full Paper</a>] <span>[<a href="http://mldiscuss.appspot.com/discuss/454">Discussion</a>]</span></p><br /><hr><br />

Therefore, the proposed online algorithm can be very efficient and scalable.  This is guaranteed by its low worst-case time complexity and memory cost both in the order of ${\cal O}(d)$, where $d$ is the number of dimensions.

<p class="abstracts">Dimension reduction is popular for learning predictive models in high-dimensional spaces. It can highlight the relevant part of the feature space and avoid the curse of dimensionality. However, it can also be harmful because any reduction loses information. In this paper, we propose the projection penalty framework to make use of dimension reduction without losing valuable information .Reducing the feature space before learning predictive models can be viewed as restricting the model search to some parameter subspace. The idea of projection penalties is that instead of restricting the search to a parameter subspace, we can search in the full space but penalize the projection distance to this subspace. Dimension reduction is used to guide the search, rather than to restrict it.We propose projection penalties for linear dimension reduction, and then generalize to kernel-based reduction and other nonlinear methods. We test projection penalties with various dimension reduction techniques in different prediction tasks, including principal component regression and partial least squares in regression tasks, kernel dimension reduction in face recognition, and latent topic modeling in text classification. Experimental results show that projection penalties are a more effective and reliable way to make use of dimension reduction techniques.</p><p class="discussion">[<a href="papers/481.pdf">Full Paper</a>] <span>[<a href="http://mldiscuss.appspot.com/discuss/481">Discussion</a>]</span></p><br /><hr><br />

<p class="abstracts">Markov logic networks (MLNs) use first-order formulas to define features of Markov networks.

To address this problem,we present LSM, the first MLN structure learner capable of efficiently and accurately learning long clauses. LSM is based on the observation that relational data typically contains patterns that are variations of the same structural motifs. By constraining the search for clauses to occur within motifs, LSM can greatly speed up the search and thereby reduce the cost of finding long clauses. LSM uses random walks to identify densely connected objects in data, and groups them and their associated relations into a motif.Our experiments on three real-world datasets show that our approach is 2-5 orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art ones, while achieving the same or better predictive performance.</p><p class="discussion">[<a href="papers/502.pdf">Full Paper</a>] <span>[<a href="http://mldiscuss.appspot.com/discuss/502">Discussion</a>]</span></p><br /><hr><br />

We propose bottom-up search as an alternative, inspired by the analogous approach in the field of rule induction.  Our BLM algorithm starts with each complete training example as a long feature, and repeatedly generalizes a feature to match its $k$ nearest examples by dropping variables.

<p class="abstracts">We consider the problem of how to improve the efficiency of Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL). MKL is often regarded as a convex-concave optimization problem, which is convex on the kernel weights and concave on the SVM dual variables. In literature, the alternating approach is widely observed: (1) the minimization of the kernel weights is solved by complicated techniques, such as Semi-infinite Linear Programming, Gradient Descent, or Level method; (2) the maximization of SVM dual variables can be solved by standard SVM solvers. However, the minimization over kernel weights in these methods is usually dependent on its solving techniques or commercial softwares, which therefore limits the efficiency and applicability. In this paper, we formulate a closed-form solution for the optimization of kernel weights based on the equivalence between group-lasso and MKL. Although this equivalence is not our invention, our derived variant equivalence not only lead  to an efficient algorithm for MKL, but also generalize this equivalence to that between Lp-MKL (p >=1 and denoting the Lp-norm of kernel weights) and group lasso, which does not appear in literature. Therefore, our proposed algorithm provides a unified solution for the whole family of Lp-MKL models.

In this setting, training instances are connected by a set of links to form a network, the labels of linked nodes are correlated, and the goal is to exploit these dependencies and accurately label the nodes.  This problem arises in many domains, including social and biological network analysis and document classification, and there has been much recent interest in methods that collectively classify the nodes in the network. While in many cases labeled examples are expensive, often network information is available. We show how an active learning algorithm can take advantage of network structure.  Our algorithm effectively exploits the links between instances and the interaction between the local and collective aspects of a classifier to improve the accuracy of learning from fewer labeled examples.

As a consequence, fewer exploratory actions should be enough to learn a good policy. Strangely enough, current theoretical results for model-based algorithms do not support this claim: In a finite Markov decision process with N states, the best bounds on the number of exploratory steps necessary are of order O(N^2 log N), in contrast to the O(N log N) bound available for the model-free, delayed Q-learning algorithm. In this paper we show that MoRmax, a modified version of the Rmax algorithm needs to make at most O(N log N) exploratory steps. This matches the lower bound up to logarithmic factors, as well as the upper bound of the state-of-the-art model-free algorithm, while our new bound improves the dependence on other problem parameters.</p><p class="discussion">[<a href="papers/546.pdf">Full Paper</a>] <span>[<a href="http://mldiscuss.appspot.com/discuss/546">Discussion</a>]</span></p><br /><hr><br />

By treating the budget maintenance as a source of the gradient error, we prove that the gap between the budgeted Pegasos and the optimal solution directly depends on the average model degradation due to budget maintenance. To minimize the model degradation, we study greedy multi-class budget maintenance methods based on removal, projection, and merging of support vectors.

Unlike most prior IRL algorithms which recover only the control policy of the expert, we recover the policy, the value function and the cost function. This is possible because here the cost and value functions are uniquely defined given the policy. Despite these special properties, we can handle a wide variety of problems such as the grid worlds popular in RL and most of the nonlinear problems arising in robotics and control engineering. Direct comparisons to prior IRL algorithms show that our new algorithms provide more information and are orders of magnitude faster. Indeed our fastest algorithm is the first inverse algorithm which does not require solving the forward problem; instead it performs unconstrained optimization of a convex and easy-to-compute log-likelihood. Our work also sheds light on the recent Maximum Entropy (MaxEntIRL) algorithm, which was defined in terms of density estimation and the corresponding forward problem was left unspecified. We show that MaxEntIRL is inverting an LMDP, using the less efficient of the algorithms derived here. Unlike all prior IRL algorithms which assume pre-existing features, we study feature adaptation and show that such adaptation is essential in continuous state spaces. </p><p class="discussion">[<a href="papers/571.pdf">Full Paper</a>] <span>[<a href="http://mldiscuss.appspot.com/discuss/571">Discussion</a>]</span></p><br /><hr><br />

We formulate the learning task as a convex minimization over both the weights and the dual variables corresponding to each data point. As a result, we can begin to optimize the weights even before completely solving any of the individual prediction problems.

Many of them essentially map the large dataset into a small set of basis points. A common approach to learn these basis points is evidence maximization. Nevertheless, maximized evidence may lead to over fitting and cause high computational cost for optimization. In this paper, we propose a novel sparse GP regression approach, GPLasso, that explicitly represents the trade-off between its approximation quality and the model sparsity. GPLasso minimizes a $\ell_1$-penalized KL divergence between the exact and sparse GP posterior processes. Optimizing this convex cost function leads to sparse GP parameters. Furthermore, we use low-rank matrix approximation (for example, incomplete Cholesky factorization) in our optimization procedure to significantly reduce the computational cost. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with several state-of-the-art sparse GP methods and direct low-rank matrix approximation methods, GPLasso achieves a much improved balance between prediction accuracy and computational cost.</p><p class="discussion">[<a href="papers/636.pdf">Full Paper</a>] <span>[<a href="http://mldiscuss.appspot.com/discuss/636">Discussion</a>]</span></p><br /><hr><br />

Pooling is used to achieve invariance to image transformations, more compact representations, and better robustness to noise and clutter.  Several papers have shown that the details of the pooling operation can greatly influence the performance, but studies have so far been purely empirical.  In this paper, we show that the reasons underlying the performance of various pooling methods are obscured by several confounding factors, such as the link between the sample cardinality in a spatial pool and the resolution at which low-level features have been extracted. We provide a detailed theoretical analysis of max pooling and average pooling, and give extensive empirical comparisons for object recognition tasks.</p><p class="discussion">[<a href="papers/638.pdf">Full Paper</a>] <span>[<a href="http://mldiscuss.appspot.com/discuss/638">Discussion</a>]</span></p><br /><hr><br />
<a name="642"></a><p>Paper ID: 642</p> <h3>Comparing Clusterings in Space</h3> <p><em>Michael Coen (UW-Madison); Hidayath Ansari (UW-Madison); Nathanael Fillmore (UW-Madison)</em></p> 
<p class="abstracts">This paper proposes a new method for comparing clusterings both partitionally and geometrically.  Our approach is motivated by the following observation: the vast majority of previous techniques for comparing clusterings are entirely partitional, i.e., they examine assignments of points in set theoretic terms after they have been partitioned.  In doing so, these methods ignore the spatial layout of the data, disregarding the fact that this information is responsible for generating the clusterings to begin with.  We demonstrate that this leads to a variety of failure modes.  Previous comparison techniques often fail to differentiate between significant changes made in data being clustered.  We formulate a new measure for comparing clusterings that combines spatial and partitional information into a single measure using optimization theory.  Doing so eliminates pathological conditions in previous approaches.  It also simultaneously removes common limitations, such as that each clustering must have the same number of clusters or the yare over identical datasets.  This approach is stable, easily implemented, and has strong intuitive appeal.</p><p class="discussion">[<a href="papers/642.pdf">Full Paper</a>] <span>[<a href="http://mldiscuss.appspot.com/discuss/642">Discussion</a>]</span></p><br /><hr><br />
<a name="643"></a><p>Paper ID: 643</p> <h3>High-Performance Semi-Supervised Learning using Discriminatively Constrained Generative Models</h3> <p><em>Gregory Druck (University of Massachusetts Am); Andrew McCallum (University of Massachusetts Amherst)</em></p> <p class="abstracts">We develop a semi-supervised learning method that constrains the posterior distribution of latent variables under a generative model to satisfy a rich set of feature expectation constraints estimated with labeled data.  This approach encourages the generative model to discover latent structure that is relevant to a prediction task.  We estimate parameters with a coordinate ascent algorithm, one step of which involves training a discriminative log-linear model with an embedded generative model.  This hybrid model can be used for test time prediction.  Unlike other high-performance semi-supervised methods, the proposed method converges to a local maximum of a single objective function, and affords additional flexibility, for example to use different latent and output spaces.  We conduct experiments on three sequence labeling tasks, achieving the best reported results on two of them, and showing promising results on CoNLL03 NER.  </p><p class="discussion">[<a href="papers/643.pdf">Full Paper</a>] <span>[<a href="http://mldiscuss.appspot.com/discuss/643">Discussion</a>]</span></p><br /><hr><br />
<a name="652"></a><p>Paper ID: 652</p> <h3>Nonparametric Return Distribution Approximation for Reinforcement Learning</h3> <p><em>Tetsuro Morimura (IBM Research - Tokyo); Masashi Sugiyama (Tokyo Institute Of Technology); Hisashi Kashima (University of Tokyo); Hirotaka Hachiya; Toshiyuki Tanaka</em></p> <p class="abstracts">Standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to optimize decision-making rules in terms of the expected return. However, especially for risk-management purposes, other criteria such as the expected shortfall are sometimes preferred. Here, we describe a method of approximating the distribution of returns, which allows us to derive various kinds of information about the returns. We first show that the Bellman equation, which is a recursive formula for the expected return, can be extended to the cumulative return distribution. Then we derive a nonparametric return distribution estimator with particle smoothing based on this extended Bellman equation. A key aspect of the proposed algorithm is to represent the recursion relation in the extended Bellman equation by a simple replacement procedure of particles associated with a state by using those of the successor state. We show that our algorithm leads to a risk-sensitive RL paradigm. The usefulness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through numerical experiments.</p><p class="discussion">[<a href="papers/652.pdf">Full Paper</a>] <span>[<a href="http://mldiscuss.appspot.com/discuss/652">Discussion</a>]</span></p><br /><hr><br />
<a name="654"></a><p>Paper ID: 654</p><h3>Should one compute the Temporal Difference fix point or minimize the Bellman Residual? The unified oblique projection view</h3> <p><em>Bruno Scherrer (Loria)</em></p> <p class="abstracts">We investigate projection methods, for evaluating a linear approximation of the value function of a policy in a Markov Decision Process context. We consider two popular approaches, the one-step Temporal Difference fix-point computation (TD(0)) and the Bellman Residual (BR) minimization.  We describe examples, where each method outperforms the other. We highlight a simple relation between the objective function they minimize, and show that while BR enjoys a performance guarantee, TD(0) does not in general. We then propose a unified view in terms of oblique projections of the Bellman equation, which substantially simplifies and extends the characterization of Schoknecht (2002) and the recent analysis of Yu and Bertsekas (2008).  Eventually, we describe some simulations that suggest that if the TD(0) solution is usually slightly better than the BR solution, its inherent numerical instability makes it very bad in some cases, and thus worse on average.</p><p class="discussion">[<a href="papers/654.pdf">Full Paper</a>] <span>[<a href="http://mldiscuss.appspot.com/discuss/654">Discussion</a>]</span></p><br /><hr><br />
